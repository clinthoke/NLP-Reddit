DisneyWorld,"So, we are trying to solve a bit of a mystery that occurred with WDW security at the main entrance gate last week. 

I have a pal who attended WDW last week with a party of 10 family members. One morning, nine of those members entered the park, but the 10th was running behind. When he arrived a while later, he was stopped upon trying to scan his ticket/wristband. The CM said, “I’m sorry we’re not letting you in. I need to call security.” A few security officers came out a few minutes later with an iPad, and showed him a picture of a man from a security camera inside the park somewhere, and said, “Do you know this man?” He replied, “Yes, that’s my father in law.” “That’s your father in law?” replied a security officer. “Yes, his name is Billy Smith.” The security officer paused, and then said, “Ok, you can enter the park. I’ll make sure your band works for the rest of your visit.” And that was it.

DisneyWorld,,RotR was the best ride I've ever been on
DisneyWorld,"I was listening to a recent episode of [The Dis Dudes Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/episode/26N1zk1U2Ar4aQnoBrTk3J) and they were talking about the good, the  bad, and the ugly about Galaxy's Edge. They mentioned how horrible the pilot selection can be and how it can make or break the ride for the rest of the crew. I have a solution to this problem that will help out both Smuggler's Run and Galaxy's Edge as a whole.

**Pilot Training / Pilot only queue**

Just hear me out for a second. A major problem is that pilots are chosen randomly, which can negatively affect the experience if the pilot is bad or doesn't fully understand how to work the controls. Galaxy's Edge should have a ""Pilot Training Course"" which can be its own mini attraction; to be eligible you must have ridden as a crew member first. This course can be as simple as a small building where you go and test your skills and if you pass, then you become a certified pilot. If you fail (maybe give a couple of chances), then you either have to stay a crew member or have to get back in line for training. I believe that the test should be harder than the minimum skills required to operate Smuggler's Run as is, to reward great pilots and to not dilute the meaning of what it means to be a Certified pilot. Certified pilots (tracked either by a pin or through your magic band) will enter a separate queue for the ride, and can be recognized by some of the characters of Batuu. If you crash the Millennium Falcon, you get your status revoked and you have to go through training again. 

**What does this solve?**

1. A lot of people have said that being a part of a crew with bad pilots can make the whole ride not as fun. Since there is only so much that the crew can do, most of the experience heavily relies on the pilot. Bad pilot = bad ride and vice versa. 
2. The randomness will be mostly eliminated, having separate queue lines.
3. This rewards guests who visit often, guests who really love Galaxy's edge, and guests who like to build immersion.

**Does this mean that pilots get a FastPass?**

At first, maybe. You also have to consider the time that it takes to get to be a certified pilot. First you have to ride the ride as a standard crew member, then you'll have to stand in line for the ""Training Course"", stand in line for the Pilot only queue. After some time, the pilot queue will probably be just as long as the standard queue and rightfully so, it is the most fun part of the ride. This also means that for the average first time guest, wait times should decrease to be a part of a standard queue.

 **What if there are no pilots available/ parties of 5+?**

* If there are no pilots available in the pilot queue, then you can just revert back the random pilot choosing (they also enact an auto pilot or easy driving mode, but going back to the current system would probably be easiest)
* The same can be said for parties of 5 or more, they would just revert back to the random current system and choose 2 people out of the large party.
* If a certified pilot/s are with a party, the party would also go in the pilot queue and be a part of that crew, then the rest of the crew would be filled by standard crew members/single riders.

Let me know what you think or how you could improve on my idea or if you have any ideas of your own.",Smuggler's Run and Galaxy's Edge Upgrade

So I'm super pumped about going to Disney for the first time in June! I've waited 30 years to go and I'm finally going with my husband! He surprised me with the trip and I've been planning a bunch of things that I really want to do!

But there's been a few questions I haven't been able to find the answers to. So I figured I'd ask all you knowledgeable people!

First off, I LOVE the villains and I've always wanted to meet them and have my picture taken with them! But I haven't been able to figure out if they're in the parks like the other characters. Will I be able to meet them and have my picture taken with say Maleficent or the Evil Queen in June? Or are they only around during Halloween time?

Secondly, how worried should I be about Hurricane season and bad storms? I know hurricane season is June-November and we'll be going mid-June.

Lastly, is line cutting a serious issue, and how should I prepare myself for dealing with rude guests?

My girlfriend looks at her confused and so SHE SAYS IT TO HER AGAIN. “You’re engaged!! So exciting!” 

Now they both shoot confused looks at me and I can’t lie or even drop to a knee because I don’t have the ring in our luggage! (To keep her from seeing it I let my brother hang into it in his bag to meet later today so I can propose TOMORROW at Star Wars! ...Her favorite!) 

So now, both staring at me I tell her, “SURPRISE I’m gonna propose to you tomorrow! Whole family is here to see it and you two are confused BECAUSE IT HASN’T HAPPENED YET!”   
...

Host gave us free breakfast coupon and autograph book to “make it right” but I feel like someone killed my puppy because I know she’s been dreaming of having me propose to her at Disney world and I’ve been dreaming of surprising her with a ring here at a Star Wars ride. I really wanted to see the priceless look on her face as I *surprised her* and professed my love and asked her if she wants to marry me. But NOPE!

But the full price is 349.00 and with tax 371.69. I was wondering if i had to pay the full price and the down payment with the monthly pay. Which will equal to 530.09 not including the tax from the down payment and the monthly payment. Or do i have to pay the down payment and of course the monthly payment until i pay it off?,Question about Disney AP

DisneyWorld,"Just got back from WDW a few minutes ago. We spent 4 days, one at each park and fucked off at Disney Springs for a little bit today. We did the Animal Kingdom After hours and then Villains last night. The animal kingdom one I loved even though when we got off Flight of the Na’vi for the last time of the night it was DUMPING rain, I had high hopes for Villains. It seemed that it took quite a while to clear out the standby lines at MK once the park closed and even then while it was definitely less crowded than during the day there were still 20 minute lines for most of the rides vs just walking on. I got to ride Everest 3 times back to back at AK and I didn’t feel rushed. 9-12 esp on a Friday is just too short of a time. We saw the show but missed out on the Malificient parade and I still didn’t get to ride everything that I wanted to but I hit most of what I didn’t get to ride during the day but we did go through like 7 fast passes between 11 and normal close. I’d say it was still worth it but it’d be nicer if they extended it to 1am so that people don’t feel as rushed. I guess when I really think about it though they put a lot of thought and effort into that event but I’d probably choose a normal afterhours at MK next time over Villains.

Quickly approaching 180 days out from our trip and we are hoping to score a dinner reservation at CRT! This is #1 on the list for a few people in the group and I would really love to get this right. I had a few questions I hadn’t seen covered here yet and probably just need some reassuring more than anything 😬. We’ll be staying on property with Disney dining plan and be staying Sept. 3 -8 of 2020 with 6 adults 1 child (4) and 1 infant (2). Please feel free to speak on any one item or if you have any general advice on this you have! Thanks in advance for all your help! 

1. Can you make a reservation for the last night of your trip 180 days out from your first night of your stay? (I’m thinking like how fastpass works) or is it 180 days from the night you want to reserve regardless of staying on property or packages?

2. Any believers in using the direct dining reservation phone line vs. online?? Would love to hear why. 

3. Is there any differences with making a res using dining plan that I should be aware of? 

4. IF there are time options, what would you recommend? (Seeing the fireworks show is a priority 💥 🏰 💥)

DisneyWorld,"This past week was incredible! We stayed at All Star Music. We arrived around 7pm and learned we had been upgraded to a nicer (and refurbished) room! We were celebrating my boyfriend’s birthday and he got spoiled all week with drinks and cupcakes and even some fast passes. 

Our original trip was scheduled the weekend hurricane Dorian hit so we rescheduled. Disney allowed me to keep all the fast passes I had scheduled and let me schedule more on top of that. When the hurricane fast passes didn’t work, guest services fixed it immediately. We got to do everything we wanted. 

I am vegan and I was spoiled all week with incredible meals and fantastic service. Hoop Dee Doo was especially note worthy (thank you Chef Brian) as we were seated directly in front of the stage and the chef was there when we sat, stating all the food options and even gave me some extras on top of that. 

My boyfriend got us a fast pass for Smuggler’s Run and we were able to do that twice. Galaxy’s Edge as a whole was awesome. We did ROTR and it was incredible... the Disney Magic was just what we needed. I’m so sad to be home now.

DisneyWorld,"Hey!

So I have been looking but haven't been able to find an exact answer to my question. I have a trip coming up in October (only 279 days away but who's counting?)  There are a lot of people coming in our overall group, however only 3 of us plan to stick together for the majority of the trip.

My partner and I have already booked our stay, tickets, and dining plan. My friend is going to be booking hers separately but is joining us on the days.

Is there a way to connect our accounts so I can get us on the same dining reservations/fast passes? I am also curious if we would be able to join them to get our boarding groups for Rise of the Resistance. Does anyone have experience doing this? or advice?",Planning for a Group of 3
DisneyWorld,"Hi! This is kind of complicated, but I want to plan the best vacations I can for the best prices, as I’ve taken it upon myself to boss everyone around about it. I’ve mostly gotten “whatever you want to do” or “whatever everyone else wants to do” “I’m just happy to be there” kind of things. I made a plan, and of course if someone has any issue I’ll change the plan to address that. 

My family and friends are visiting me for my graduation and birthday this summer and we all want to go to Disney. The dates are over two trips. The first will be my grandpa, my brother (UT residents) and I from August 9-10. The second are my two best friends (CA, WA) and my fiancé and I from August 31 to sept 2, then Mickeys not so scary Halloween party on the 3rd. 

We want to stay in Disney hotels, or at least I do as nobody else seems to care about specifics, but it’s plausible to stay at my house in central Tampa to just drive back and forth. It’s like an hour and a half. 

What are the best ways to go about buying tickets? How do I go about buying passes for all of us, given they send me money? Through the app, right? Do I use the package option or should I buy hotel and park tickets separately? 

My current plan is to use the “places to stay” tab, fill out the info and then go from there but it doesn’t include any Florida resident options. What if I were to buy an annual pass? How would I go about it then?


Thanks!",Best ticket buying options for vacation with FL and non-FL residents??

DisneyWorld,"Adults are not supposed to enjoy this as it's a children's theme park (similar to how Star Wars is a children's move that somehow adults really liked).

Like if I was going on vacation here without kids I'd never tell anyone. I feel guilty for enjoying it (I used to go as a kid/teen all the time, dated women who liked it, etc) and watching Disney Food Blog, Tim Tracker, and other people. 

ANYWAY 

How do you people even afford this? I wanted to say at Riviera because it has the skyliner to Epcot, which is my favorite. But the cheapest room is like $500 a night. Five nights would be $2,500 and that's not even including flight, food, etc. LOL jeezus. I technically have the money saved up and could afford it but my god is it just so much money.

DisneyWorld,"I’m curious if people have been to Disney World alone. I did a few months back and honestly it was a really mixed experience. I went to Florida for a short trip because the weather was atrocious in the UK and I’d been working crazy hours since Spring, I’d completely missed our summer and so I desperately wanted to be somewhere hot and relaxing. My partner couldn’t take any time off so I went alone, having found some insanely cheap flights + hotel.

Anyway even at the border at MCO the agents were like VERY suspicious of me. They were like ‘people don’t go to theme parks alone, why are you really here?’ when I told them my plans ‘will check out universal and Disney’. And from that moment I got in my head that actually, theme parks are for people travelling with friends and family.

A couple of things I noticed. One is that people would generally ask me why I was alone getting on rides. Especially with the single rider queue. You get seated next to a family and the dad normally quizzes you. It’s kind of hard to answer. ‘That is a complex and nuanced question. I have been working crazy hard for too long and I get depressed when I don’t see the sun and it is actually cheaper for me to get here from London than it was for me to go to Paris right now and..’ doesn’t make for a quick answer so that felt weird. Secondly, single rider on a couple of the rides at Hollywood Studios meant I had done everything, multiple times, within a few hours. So if I did it again I would definitely target doing a couple of parks in one day.

I only did Hollywood studios in the end. It was a really awesome to see some of Disney world, the stuff of childhood dreams. I’d never been to a Disney park before. I watched a YouTube video about how the tower of terror works and now YouTube won’t stop suggesting videos about Disney World, which is the why I’m still curious about this. To some extent I think the worries were put in my head by border control rather than anything Disney did. But it’d be interesting to hear if others have had that same ‘errr it’s a bit weird being here alone’ feeling?",Going alone? Fun but hard-to-shake weird feeling

Here is where the... Oversite... comes in.  She ONLY watches Moana, Lilo and Stich, and the Finding films. Trying all of the classics and other new films, we get about 10 minutes in before the familiar ""Oana, stitch, Nemo"" refrain starts again. (Lilo and Stich 2 is on while I write this). 

Here's my plea... I know I can find Nemo at Epcot and there is a show at Animal Kingdom... Are there any places where we can find Moana or Stitch characters or even references? Any suggestions?

DisneyWorld,"This may be a loaded comment, but is the Animal Kingdom consistent with the other Disney World parks?

My wife and daughter went there yesterday, some of her observations:

* Staff generally seemed haggard/cranky. Only a handful were chipper.
* There was some kind of mess up with her park pass and the ticket person was borderline insolent and acted as if she was doing my wife a favour.
* Are accessibility aids common in Orlando? For example, no handicap doors on washrooms (either automated or doorless entries). Was difficult for single parent to get around.
* Other guests were extremely helpful and friendly. Often holding the doors open and helping my wife take pictures.
* The Kilimanjaro Safari was a huge hit but we've had better ""safari"" experiences at other zoos/parks. Having the Disney characters around was great, but aside from that, the park was underwhelming. It's possible her expectations were too high because of Disney's reputation.

I've also found dealing with their customer support hit or miss after a few calls. About 2/3 of the calls were great but the remaining 1/3 was sub-par. Another thing is we're not big into rides so that may also be why we're not making the most of our stay.

DisneyWorld,"So we all just left the World today after another amazing trip.   So sad to leave it but I wanted to throw out a public service message to those are going into some potentially very crowded parks.  I would like to remind folks of a few things:

     When driving an ECV in a crowded park please keep your hands on the steering device.  Two different people nearly ran me down while riding two abreast where the fountain used to be while texting and eating.  Remember it is just like a car.  Please remember others and don’t use your phone while driving one.  It is just like a car and you can hurt people.  After jumping out of the way I yelled back to them to stop texting and received a finger back in turn.  Please remember others as you can really hurt someone with one of those vehicles moving at speed.  

     The second reminder is for those using a stroller.  Before I say anything,  I know it is difficult.  I have been coming to the World with my 3 kids since they were born until now.  I have used double strollers-and single strollers, through parades and every season of the year.  What I would say is don’t use them as a weapon to part the crowds.  I was walking down the middle of Main Street after the Mickeys Christmas fireworks.  A women with a double stroller darted across the street striking me in the back of the leg trying to cross the street while everyone is exiting.  I cried out, as I just got hit by a stroller in the back of the knee.  She said “sorry” angrily. I said to her you have to be more careful.  Her husband then yelled “She said Sorry”.  I guess that makes it ok then to sprint across a park and hit people.  She replied that it is hard to move a stroller through the park.   I told her I get it, I have three kids and proudly can say after 13 visits to the park I never hit a single person.    She then skulked across into a store.  

So as the Holiday starts and the parks become overwhelmed with people.  Please be careful.  You don’t want to hurt anybody. Be patient and remember we all want to have fun.  Take care and Happy Thanksgiving!",Just a reminder - ECV’s and Strollers

Now, please correct me if the below is wrong.

As I understand, let's say we have a FP selection for Space Mountain, we all go up to the attendant, let them know we would like to add a RS to my band because I'll be staying behind with the 4mo.  After my wife and 4yo finishes the ride, I can go with my 4yo again while my wife watches the 4mo.  Is this correct?

From other forums, there seems to be another hack where we can make use of the RS and FP to obtain more rides?  I am not sure how that would work if someone can explain it using our family setup.

We know this may seem different but we feel the experience and memories will outlast anything we could have bought them. We started looking at tickets and realized it’s a lot more expensive than our trip to Disneyland a few years back. We will be driving there in a 15 passenger van and make a nice little road trip from it. Not sure if this is allowed and if not please delete the post, is there any deals that we could be using before we pull out the card and make the leap?

DisneyWorld,"My family is planning a trip to Disney and we have 7 days. Here’s our schedule so far

Day one (half day):Epcot
Day two : Hollywood studios
Day three: ?
Day four:?
Day five: Animal Kingdom
Day six:?
Day seven: departure

We had originally planned to do MK on 3 , a break day on 4 and Epcot again on 6.

But now we are wondering if we should do MK on 3 and 6 and just another half day at Epcot on 4 with a partial break.
Idk which park I need more time at, but I feel like 2 half days at Epcot won’t work?

I am being sent to Orlando on a work trip for a week. I will have  hours at the end of each day that I'll be able to not have to be doing work things, and sometimes I might be able to clock out early.
One of my dreams has been to visit Disney, specifically to see pirates of the Caribbean and haunted Mansion.

My wife and i went to Florida for our honey moon buy choose a bunch of small things.ibstead of just Disney.

Are there inexpensive ways for me to attending the evenings, even for one night? I looked at the day passes cost around 120 for any of the days I wanna go and that is quite a bit for only being able to catch  the tail end of the day

Also, to clarify the rule, does the 7 day limit apply only to the 3 advance FP's per day or you can't even make same day FP's?","If I convert a 10 day ticket to an annual pass, what happens to the FP's I've already made?"

DisneyWorld,"I've heard of people having a magical moment at Disney but my boyfriend has an amazing story. His family, who NEVER eats fast food, won the Millennium trip from a McDonald's french fry container years back. They got private rides in and out of the park, hand and foot catering, free flights to and from Disney and best of all they stayed in the top of the castle in the magic kingdom. It was actually really amazing for them because they had just had a house fire and had no place to stay. So after the trip was over they ended up booking another week until they finally went home to stay with family. It was literally, in his opinion, the best service Disney could offer. 

So, that's my question. If money wasn't an object what's the coolest thing you can do at Disney in your opinion? What is the cream of the crop best possibly experience a person can get? Obviously a lot of personal opinion, but I'm interested in hearing what you guys have seen or heard of!",If money wasn't an issue- what is the best thing you can buy from Disney?

DisneyWorld,"I visited the parks this past weekend and tried the standard dining plan for the first time.  This was a bit of an ambitious decision, since our resort stay was four nights long, but my friend and I only had two and a half days at the parks together.  (I had one day at the parks by myself).  We figured we would be able to use all of the meals, and I liked the idea of eating what I wanted to eat without feeling the sting of money going out each time.

I kept track of what we spent and plugged it into a spreadsheet after I got home.  I tracked the value of the food and drinks we bought, along with the additional costs not included in the dining plan (extra alcohol and tips).  I then noted what I thought we would have spent if not on the dining plan.  There were a couple of food items I would not have eaten if I hadn't been trying to burn credits, and I would have skimped on a few drinks to save money if they hadn't been paid for.  (For example, I had a couple of drinks with breakfast/lunch that I wouldn't have ordinarily bought).

In total, we got $827 in food and drinks for the $606 cost of our meal plan.  I figured we would have spent $630 out of pocket on food and drink without the meal plan.  At first I was pretty excited to see that we came out ahead on this whole thing.  But then I realized I needed to add the additional non-covered costs to our meal plan figure to accurately compare that amount to the amount we would have spent.  Once I included tips and additional non-covered alcohol, the value flipped.  We would have probably spent about $630 without a meal plan, and spent $731 when you add the cost of the meal plan to our non-covered costs.

So, in sum, the meal plan paid for itself and then some, but we still would have been better off paying a la carte because we would have eaten and drank a little less.

DisneyWorld,"Hey everyone,

My family and I are headed out to Disney World for 6 days from San Diego in January to celebrate my graduation this coming December. Our fastpass selection day is this Saturday and I had a couple questions about how it works.

Our travel group is myself, my girlfriend, and my mom and dad. 

Say my parents don't want to go on a ride that my gf and I want to get fastpasses for, can we get them 2 fastpasses for another ride without it counting towards our 3 total? Is it 3 fastpasses per person or 3 different fastpass reservations? I haven't been able to find an answer for that online anywhere.

Second question is, how quickly do fast passes tend to sell out? Like I mentioned, we are out in California so the fast passes go live at 4am on Saturday. Will I have any shot at getting good fastpasses if I wait until 6am or so my time or do I need to be on the second they go live to get passes for rides like flight of passage?

Thanks in advance!",Fastpass reservation system question

Instead I went for shows and safaris because I read a lot of the animal stuff is not available during the event. 

Recently was talking to someone about this, and they pretty much implied how I wouldn't be able to do any of these rides during this event because of crowd size. They  explained the event is just as busy as during the day and maybe I can get on 1 ride if I wait the entire event in line.

Is this right?? I know these events can be busy and during this time of year it can be crazy, but I also know no FP during this time and there is a limited number of tickets. I'm not expecting empty parks and no lines, but not as bad as this person explained to me.",Animal Kingdom FPs

My Girlfriend, her daughter and I are coming from the UK for a week at WDW in May 2020 and our ability to book dining begins next week. We follow DisneyFoodBlog and have seen TONS of snacks that look amazing that we're going to want to try, but have very limited knowledge on meal choices!

I know it's no urgency but me and my partner have a booking for disneyworld next year in December to stay at port Orleans. 

Im just wandering if anyone knows if Disney are honouring the booking made through Thomas Cook 


Now obviously everything that has happened I need to know what's Disney approach is. 

I've had an offer from virign to book a holiday again but don't want to commit without knowing whether Disney are honouring the booking or not. 

Although the hotel was booked through Disney we have been paying Thomas Cook every month. 

I hope someone out there can help and fill me in on this

DisneyWorld,,"I really love this pic from ""Big Thunder Mountain"""
DisneyWorld,"**Ladies and gentlemen, I write to you today to share an objective truth and to back that truth up with concrete and indisputable evidence. That truth is this: Wall-E belongs in every Walt Disney World park.**

For those of you unfamiliar with Wall-E, it is a film that focuses on a trash-compacting robot on Earth after humanity abandoned the planet on the luxury star-liner *The Axiom*. They left behind an army of Wall-E robots to clean up the planet while humanity relaxes on The Axiom and the only robot still operational is the one the film focuses on. Over time, Wall-E has developed a personality and a penchant for collecting interesting items that he comes across including Rubix cubes, replacement parts, and a lone plant growing on its own. Not long after the events of the film begin, a probe known as Eve is dispatched to Earth for a routine scan for life. Wall-E quickly falls in love and presents the plant to Eve as a sign of affection. Her automated programming collects the plant - evidence of a friendly ecosystem on Earth - and she is taken back to the Axiom as a part of the process to returning the Axiom to Earth. Wall-E, not ready to give up on Eve, stows away on the rocket back to the Axiom and the remainder of the film is about Wall-E, Eve, and the Captain of the Axiom completing the process of returning to Earth.

Wall-E is very obviously a criticism of capitalism and over-consumption and offers a very bleak outlook of the future of Earth as a result of that over-consumption. 

To break down how and where Wall-E fits into the parks, what better place to start than Magic Kingdom?

 * Obviously, we have to focus on Tomorrowland. There's really nowhere else Wall-E can go in Magic Kingdom and that's okay. Tomorrowland works because of what type of aesthetic Tomorrowland is going for. Tomorrowland adopts a cartoony retrofuturistic aesthetic, like that of the Jetsons. Pristine architecture and walkways and convenience around every corner. The Axiom follows this aesthetic beautifully. Robots cater to the Axiom passengers' every whim. Hair-dressers, massage therapists, food delivery. Passengers don't even need to walk around. They spend all of their time on hover chairs completely plugged into the intranet of the Axiom. The entire ship is *spotless* and has robots dedicated to eradicating any foreign contaminants. If Wall-E were to go into Magic Kingdom, Tomorrowland would be the perfect host to an Axiom-focused attraction setting. It's worth mentioning that ""Put On Your Sunday Clothes"" from Hello, Dolly! can often be heard on Main Street USA and that number is heard during the opening of Wall-E and can be heard more throughout the film, but that's Hello, Dolly!, not Wall-E.

 * Epcot is the next park chronologically, so why not move on to that one? This one is a tiny bit trickier because the identity of Epcot is currently in flux. What we do know is that Epcot will be broken up into [four ""neighborhoods""](https://cdn1.parksmedia.wdprapps.disney.com/media/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sdflk4560954836.jpg) and currently the obvious home for a Wall-E-themed attraction would be World Discovery. That is where the futuristic attractions will be once the overhaul is complete with Mission: Space, the Space 220 restaurant, Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, Test Track, and the Play Pavilion. Perhaps an overhaul of Mission: Space could be achieved to let us experience Wall-E's journey from Earth to the Axiom and back. I know Epcot is getting too IP-heavy for a lot of peoples' tastes, but the earlier we accept it, the happier we'll be. Embrace the IPcot.  

 * Hollywood Studios is probably the least compelling of the four. This park is currently home to numerous Pixar experiences - far more than any other park. There's the entirety of Toy Story Land, the Incredibles Celebration in Pixar Place, the new Lightning McQueen Racing Academy show up next to Rockin' Roller Coaster, and a variety of Meet and Greets. Additionally, there's a popular rumor swirling that Rockin' Roller Coaster will get a Monsters Inc. re-theme. Alongside Star Wars, it seems like Pixar is slowly taking over Hollywood Studios. Wall-E is a Pixar film and therefore belongs in Hollywood Studios! Voyage of the Little Mermaid is honestly an outdated show and could serve as a venue for a Wall-E-centric show, but honestly, there's a lot that can be changed about Hollywood Studios and it's probably the most flexible regarding how Wall-E could be implemented.

 * Last on the list, is Animal Kingdom. Animal Kingdom pushes wildlife conservation quite a bit throughout the park. Kilimanjaro Safaris pushes wildlife conservation and every transaction within Animal Kingdom offers guests the opportunity to donate to the World Wildlife Foundation. Educating guests about animals and their habitats brings us closer to them and helps us understand how delicate they are and how much they need us to protect them. Wall-E has a pretty heavy-handed message about the impact humanity has on the planet and how it is the duty of humanity to protect its wildlife and that message aligns very well with Animal Kingdom. Discovery Island is the only place Wall-E could really fit because it definitely doesn't fit within Africa, Asia, Pandora, or Dinoland! Here is where they could lean heavily emphasize Wall-E's message of environmental protection.

And there you have it. Is Wall-E the most versatile Disney property considering it has a home in each of Disney's four unique parks? Admittedly, there's a lot of overlap between Tomorrowland and World Discovery in Epcot, but not a lot of overlap (if any) between those two and Animal Kingdom and slotting into the evolving Hollywood Studios by virtue of being a Pixar IP isn't to be taken for granted, either.

Shockingly, despite all of this, there is almost zero Wall-E representation to be spoken of. It's truly disappointing, especially considering how well he fits into every park.

**Thank you for taking the time to read this. If you have any other ideas for how Wall-E could be implemented in the parks or another property that you feel belongs in every park just like Wall-E, feel free to share!**",Wall-E Belongs in Every Walt Disney World Park - An Essay

And as for one of those days being a Sunday, I’d assume it’s gonna be much busier. Which order of parks is the best to do?

Last question, I think I understand how fast passes work. We’re going to buy a 4-day ticket bundle, I’m assuming that will allow us to just choose which park when we get there right? And do I get my 3 free fast passes for each day, or just 3 total for the entirety of the 4 days? And which rides are recommended to use these on?

Sorry, this is a bit all over the place. Like I said, a little overwhelmed on all of the options.",Is one full day per park enough?
DisneyWorld,I am leaving to go to disney world on monday for 5 days. We got all 5 days with the park hopper passes. Now that I actually have them and am going through our plans I am realizing that there isnt a lot of free time. If I DONT use my park hopper passes does Disney refund you? I wont be going back for a few years so I doubt they would be good next time we go another time.,Park hopper question
DisneyWorld,"So I bought some park hoppers tonight. On delivery option I selected mail, not realizing(despite doing the 3 times prior) that I need the ticket codes to book my fast passes. Mail won’t show up for at least two wells and I need the ticket codes ASAP. We are doing what I call the 4’n’1 with galaxy’s edge so fast passes were precisely planned and need to be booked. Planning on calling Disney support in the morning. Any other advice? (Tickets were not tied to either me or my dads my Disney experience acct despite using them at checkout)",Ticket ordering screwup(help me)

DisneyWorld,"My wife and I love everything Disney and Star Wars, but smugglers run was extremely disappointing IMO.  Wait times today were pretty short &lt; 60 min, so that was a non-issue.  We both got to be the pilot, which I heard was the most fun.  Without going into too much detail, the ride is really forgettable, with no real Star Wars authenticity or WOW factor aside from being in the Falcon.  You end up half-paying attention to what is happening on-screen and half-paying attention to the 5  buttons you need to press.  I feel really bad for the people who waited in line for one of the other roles that isn’t even as interactive or fun.  I really think Disney dropped the ball big time on this one.

DisneyWorld,"I rode it July 2018 with my husband and it was a super fast takeoff.. we sat in the first row and it was amazing ... it was not my first time ever riding it but it was the first time in several years. 

Today, we rode it again for the first time since last year and we were super excited for it , sat in the first row again ready for the super fast takeoff.. well needless to say it felt nothing like how it used to. It was fast, but not the same feeling of last year. We both said it after the ride, I feel like it had to be different since both of us said the exact same thing? We even tried it again later in the day, and same result. 

We don’t go to theme parks often maybe once a year if that ..  we rode Hulk at universal a few days ago  and the takeoff felt exciting and the same as last year. 

Does anyone else have the same feeling or know if they slowed it down? We were pretty disappointed because the whole ride felt different. I’m not trying to be a downer but I’m just wondering why we both felt it was different.",Has Rock’n roller coasters take off slowed down recently?

DisneyWorld,"Hi everyone! My family and I (5 adults) just booked our first ever trip to Disney World for 5 nights and 4 days in January! We’re super excited, but really overwhelmed as well. We ended up getting the middle-tier dining plan (1 snack, 1 QS, 1 TS) for 5 days, so we have an extra days worth of credits to work with.

We plan on doing at least one park/day, so we did get park hoppers. My question to all you pros (even if you’ve only been there once, you’re still a pro in my eyes lol), if this was your itinerary, where would you all be using your credits? Specifically the quick service and table service credits. There are so many restaurants to choose from, and we are all pretty adventurous eaters who just LOVE FOOD.

DisneyWorld,"We're planning a vacation in early December -- because of my mother's mobility issues, renting an ECV (scooter) is going to be a necessity.   I'm a bit concerned, however, about how easy it is going to be taking it on the busses.     While they do accommodate ECVs, my worry is that we might have to wait extra time for a bus if it already has passengers with ECVs.   And that makes me think that it \*might\* be better to rent the ECVs from the parks on an as-needed basis rather than just keeping one for the whole time we're on property.    I'm wondering if anybody here has had any experiences using ECVs (or having family members that used them) that might prove helpful.

Also how does it work when you go on a ride?    I know there are places to park strollers - does the same apply for ECVs?",ECVs at Disney World

DisneyWorld,"Hey, everybody! I got back from Disney World Sunday afternoon, relaxed most of Labor Day and now I'm ready to put together a trip report detailing my visit to the Black Spire Outpost on Batuu on opening day! I made the trip from New England with my sister and we met up with a bunch of friends that we made through Discord - some local to Orlando, some from Florida but within driving distance, and others not local to the area. It was a big weekend because of Galaxy's Edge so there were a lot of people we knew there!

**Wednesday - Arrival and Epcot**

We arrived at around 11 AM and took the Magical Express to our resort: Coronado Springs. The new Gran Destino tower is absolutely beautiful. The lobby has some gorgeous decor. The resort must have been fairly empty because we were able to choose which area of the resort we stayed in (outside of the tower, that costs extra). We chose the one closest to the tower (and the food) and that placed us in the Casitas area. Our room wasn't quite ready yet and we were starving so we immediately made our way to El Mercado de Coronado, the quick service restaurant at the resort. Unfortunately, my sister doesn't like tex mex that much, so she wasn't a fan of most of the food offerings there and we weren't able to try any of the other restaurants at Coronado Springs.

After eating, we made our first park visit at Epcot. Because Food &amp; Wine started a day later, crowds were pretty light. This was where we first met up with a bunch of our friends. We rode Spaceship Earth, Test Track, Soarin', Living With the Land, Gran Fiesta, and Frozen Ever After with pretty minimal waits. We spent an hour or so at Cava del Tequila in Mexico and I ordered one of my favorite cocktails in all of Disney World - the Cucumber Margarita. It is no longer on the menu but you can still order it. The best way I can describe it is that it tastes like how Pirates of the Caribbean smells. It sounds crazy, but you'll see what I mean when you try it. 

We gave ourselves enough time to do a bit of shopping and then make our way to our dinner reservation at Tutto Italia. My sister and I each ordered a glass of the rubesco wine. I ordered the ziti, my sister order the lasagna, and both loved everything we tried. Highly recommend.

Finally, we watched Illuminations. This would be our last time viewing it, so we made sure to get a good spot.

My sister was nursing a sprained ankle from earlier in the summer so she decided to take it easy at the resort while myself and a few others finished the night at Trader Sam's. Not much to say here. Trader Sam's is fantastic.

**Thursday - AP magnets and Galaxy's Edge opening!**

Thanks to the reservations that we secured for Oga's Cantina, Droid Depot, and Savi's Workshop, we didn't need to be at Hollywood Studios until around noon. We spent the morning hopping around to pick the AP magnets that had dropped that day: Minnie at Epcot and (more importantly) Simba at Animal Kingdom! Hear they ran out of the latter a few days later, so I'm glad we got them when we did.

Once at Hollywood Studios, we used our Toy Story Mania fastpass and then entered Galaxy's Edge for the first time. I'm not gonna lie, I got chills and teared up a little bit while walking through the entrance tunnel. I've been following the construction of this land since it started three years ago and it's finally here. I wouldn't say I'm the biggest Star Wars fan in the world, but it has been a substantial part of my life for as long as I can remember. Being able to walk through such a detailed and immersive Star Wars land was amazing.

I immediately loaded up the Datapad on the Play Disney Parks app and was quite impressed by the breadth of experiences that are offered in the app. Someone could easily spend an entire day unlocking everything in the Datapad. There's a lot of lore to uncover in there and there were some tidbits that I found pretty amusing. It's worth checking out at least for a little bit.

Our first reservation was for Oga's Cantina and wow! This place is awesome! Pumping beats courtesy of DJ R3X, fun and engaging staff, great cocktails, lively atmosphere. This place is an incredible addition to Hollywood Studios. Because of how busy it is, you're essentially guaranteed to be sharing space with other parties. The table we were seated at was already populated by a bunch of really welcoming people so the fun started immediately. My sister and I, between the two of us tried the Yub Nub, Jedi Mind Trick, and Dagobah Slug Slinger. I really liked all three of them. The Yub Nub is easily the most popular of the drinks.

After Oga's, we met up with some of our friends again and rode Smuggler's Run. They had all ridden it several times that morning or during AP previews, so they let my sister and me pilot during our first ride and that was an awesome experience. I don't want to get into the details and spoil it for anyone, but I was totally absorbed by the experience and was so focused during the whole thing. It is an impressive addition to a park that already has a bunch of fantastic rides.

Next stop was the Droid Depot. After finding out that the droid interacts with other droids and things around Galaxy's Edge, my sister was sold on building one. She chose an R2 model with purple and white as primary colors. Getting to pick out parts from a crowded conveyor belt, assembling it at a work bench, and watching the activation sequence seems like a good time. I opted not to build a droid because I had the immense pleasure to...

Building my own lightsaber! This might have been my favorite experience of the day. The whole build process evoked nostalgia unlike anything else in Galaxy's Edge and I finally have a lightsaber of my own! It was expensive, but it was worth every penny to me. It's more than just building a lightsaber - it's a whole show-like experience and I teared up twice during the thing and my sister got a great photo of me grinning like an idiot after activating it and raising it for the first time.

We got on Smuggler's Run again, I got to try the Gunner role and then that was it for the night. I picked up an AP Galaxy's Edge opening day pin and we turned in.
____
**Friday - Magic Kingdom and Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party**

We got breakfast at the Plaza that morning because my sister wanted a more *normal* breakfast (aka not something covered in salsa). There's not much to say about it. It's not bad, but it's a breakfast. It's really hard for a breakfast to impress me. They had POG mimosas, which sound very interesting, but neither of us got one that morning.

We immediately noticed that Magic Kingdom was going to be pretty empty that day. We figured it was a combination of four factors: Food &amp; Wine Festival, Galaxy's Edge Opening, that night's Halloween Party, and Hurricane Dorian. Most rides had very short wait times and we met up with a few of our friends again and had an absolute blast. We were able to accomplish almost everything that we wanted by 5 PM or so when we decided to head back to our room to change into our Pain and Panic costumes!

I've done the Halloween party multiple times. It's one of my favorite things to do at Disney World. It was nice and relaxed because we had pretty much already done everything in Magic Kingdom that day, but definitely more crowded. We got some candy, rode Journey of the Little Mermaid and Pirates of the Caribbean and just hung out and watched the shows and parade. We scored a really sweet spot for all three right behind a unicorn crowd of people that were all happy to sit for the parade. We had a couple of people pick up on who we were, especially after seeing the Air Hercs that I made! It wasn't the most elaborate costume, but it got the job done.
____
**Saturday - Animal Kingdom and Galaxy's Edge**

Animal Kingdom is my favorite park, so we had to make another visit. We had a Safari Fast Pass in the morning followed by the new Animation Experience at Rafiki's Planet Watch. We drew Scar. All in all, it was a neat experience. I would do it again if I knew we would draw a different Disney animal. We met up with some friends again at Nomad Lounge and spent a few hours there. If you've never been, let me be one to tell you that it has a great atmosphere. They have some good food, great cocktails (my favorite is the Snow Leopard Salvation. It's made with Snow Leopard Vodka and 15% of the proceeds go to snow leopard conservation!), and the menu itself is really interesting. It's basically a journal put together by teams that went overseas to research and explore Asia and Africa for inspiration while designing Animal Kingdom. It's definitely worth checking out. A lot of their cocktails have non-alcoholic versions, as well!

After riding Flight of Passage, we went back to the hotel to pick up my sister's droid for a later revisit to Galaxy's Edge and headed to Epcot. I wanted to get a few F&amp;W items and my sister wanted to get a second tap in so that she can get the Minnie coasters on an upcoming visit. Unfortunately, Epcot was absolutely *packed*. I know it was the first weekend of F&amp;W, but I didn't expect it to be so crazy with Dorian on the way. I didn't wind up getting anything because the lines were so long. Instead, we just immediately moved on to Galaxy's Edge. Essentially, we wanted to spend as much time there with the droid as possible because my sister doesn't really see herself bringing it back down just to see it interact with other things within the park. 

When we got to Galaxy's Edge, we spent some more time wandering around and doing some activities on the Datapad. We got on Smuggler's Run again and completed the trifecta by serving as the Engineers. Our pilots were two very excited little boys and they made the experience a lot of fun. One of them couldn't even reach one of the switches he needed to pull during the ride despite trying with all his might. As Engineers, we were tasked with repairing any damage caused by the pilots crashing into things and our pilots made sure we were busy! Afterwards, closed out the night with a second trip to Oga's Cantina. This time I got the Outer Rim (not a fan) and another Dagobah Slug Slinger while my sister got the Fuzzy Tauntaun (really interesting tingling effect caused by the foam on top!) and another Yub Nub. We stood at the bar this time around and had a fun time interacting with the bar tenders there. We watched someone get a hard time for bringing ""weapons"" into the cantina (it was just some lightsabers that they purchased earlier that night), participated in the drinking songs, and chatted with some of the people nearby. Another successful evening.

**Conclusion**

That's basically it! We left Sunday morning and had zero problems getting out despite the incoming storm. I was checking the progress of the storm and it slowed down significantly while we were there. Thankfully it was enough for us to get out without any issues. We were both fully prepared to extend our trip if need be, which wouldn't have been the worst thing in the world, but not ideal.

All in all, Galaxy's Edge exceeded my expectations. Oga's Cantina and Savi's Workshop were definitely my top two experiences, but the Droid Depot, Smuggler's Run, and Datapad each offered plenty of enjoyment. I can't wait to go back. Oga's Cantina is pretty much a must-do for me on future Hollywood Studios visits. Savi's Workshop was almost like a dream come true for a life-long Star Wars fan. It's pretty much the same for Smuggler's Run, too, and I would say the hierarchy of roles would be Pilot &gt; Engineer &gt; Gunner. Although each ride is unique and has something to offer, so even if you don't get Pilot, it still has the potential to be a lot of fun. 

Disney did an awesome job creating a really immersive world. It's less like a theme park and more a totally unique setting. There are no big shows - just characters walking around, casually talking to guests or completely minding their own business - and no music - just sounds of birds and bugs, vents and fans, and the occasional ship taking off and landing. The only ""show"" I saw was Rey minding her own business while she performed some maintenance on an X-Wing and the only classic Star Wars music I heard was during my time in Savi's Workshop (and in Oga's Cantina because duh).

Lastly, it was amazing meeting up with so many friends. Galaxy's Edge brought a lot of people to Disney World at the same time and I'm so glad I made the trip.

DisneyWorld,"Hi everyone,

I am looking for some outside opinions about this predicament that my wife and I are in. We hired a friend of my wifes friend (fellow nurse who moonlights as a Disney travel agent and was their agent for a girls Disney trip they went on earlier in the year) to be the agent for our trip. She is great when we do get her on the phone, but outside of the few times we have spoken with her, I mainly communicate with her via email (which is where my problem is). 

Our agent booked the trip/hotel, MNSSHP ticket and magical express pickup but I have been the one booking all of our dining reservations and everything else that is extra. Is this normal? 

I understand being responsible for planing our one day excursion to Universal Studios as she is a Disney Agent, but everything else I figured she would help with? Am I expecting to much?

We are going to be able to select our fast passes on Saturday and I was looking for some advice from her, and since she's MIA right now (my wife says her hours are crazy), I would like some outside opinions. Should I fire her? Would that affect anything with our plans?

DisneyWorld,"So here’s what happened:
We were recently staying DVC and decided one night after Magic Kingdom closing to walk to Bay Lake Tower and spend a couple hours at Top of the World. But here’s the problem, we were parked at the TTC. The park closed at 10 so the monorail and ships close 1-1.5 hours after park closing, TOTWL didn’t close till 12. According to everything I found online we could NOT park at Bay Lake Tower without a proper reservation and since TOTWL doesn’t have reservations you can’t park at Bay Lake Tower just to go there.

Here’s what we did:
We ended up taking a Lyft to the TTC ride share / taxi pickup and walked to the car (wasn’t a big deal) after we left TOTWL. However I spoke with the security at the gate of the Contemporary / Bay Lake Tower and she said “of course you can park here for TOTWL your going to a place at the resort so you have a right to park here”. Everything online said that was not allowed, so I guess the best policy is just to ask if they say no, park at TTC and monorail over. 

Anyone have a better suggestion / idea? Would love to know!",Visiting Top of the World after Magic Kingdom

DisneyWorld,"Well, I just got back from my Passholder preview at Galaxy's Edge.  It was awesome!  To start off, our dedicated time was 1pm to 5pm.  We went at around noon expecting to have a line to wait in for our entrance time and we were let in early!  We did not have reservations for Oga's or the lightsaber building at Savi's.  We walked around for a while admiring all the detail and exploring the shops and then went on Smuggler's Run. 

Smuggler's Run was great in the Pilot position.  I think this is by far the best of the three positions.  We were able to ride Smuggler's Run 3 times and get in all three positions.  Engineer, in my opinion, is more fun than Gunner.  The first time we rode the ride, it was about a 50 minute wait.  The other two times were practically walk on.

At one point, we walked past Oga's Cantina and noticed they were letting in people without reservations were able to get into Oga's Cantina.  Most drinks that we tried were very good.  A bit expensive of course, but still good.

We were able to walk right in on the Droid Depot and create a droid with no wait a little later on into our experience.

For Savi's, we walked past at one point and I asked if they were accepting non-reservation customers.  The lady I talked to indicated they were but it would be a 2 hour wait.  About 20-30 minutes later after playing around with the Datapad game on Disney Play, we asked a different lady in the area and she indicated she had space available right away.  We were able to get two builders in.

All in all, we were able to do everything in the park.  We ate at the Docking Bay and went into Oga's Cantina. We built a droid and a lightsaber.  We rode Smuggler's Run 3 times, and walked around the area playing on the Datapad.  All of the cast were fantastic, including the characters from the movies walking around and interacting with guests.  Very good experience!",I just got back from Star Wars GE!

DisneyWorld,"Hi all,

I hope this belongs here if not please feel free to delete.

I have a question about the way bounce back works. I understand what the current offer is and that you must visit the park to get the offer.

Is it possible to book a one night stay, check in online, and then call to get the bounceback offer whilst never actually planning to stay for the night?

The dinner packages are expensive and without knowing if free dining will be offered in 2020 it could potentially save a lot of money to book a one night stay for the current bounce back promotion.

Thanks for any help anyone can give me.",Question about Bounce Back offer.

DisneyWorld,"We are planning a WDW trip this December and are attending the Mickey's Very Merry Christmas event.  I have read several places that a common practice is to avoid the park until the event gets close to starting.  However, my question is what is the actual time savings of doing so?  

I understand that questions like these aren't an exact science but another question I have is would the time savings significantly offset the increased time it would take to travel between the parks.  (Such as utilizing the bus we would have to wait on a bus, risk traffic on top of the commute itself)

My original plan was to make this our long day with the kids - Rope drop at MK and stay all day  long until the Christmas party was over, but if you all know my idea is terrible I'd love to know beforehand.

I was originally under the impression that menus had a special symbol that denoted this information but found out that this isn't necessarily true.   For example, the menu for La Cantina de San Angel doesn't have any of those symbols at all despite the fact I read that some of the menu items are applicable (I assume things like churros).   So what do we do in a case like this?    Is there some handy guide somewhere to what counts and what doesn't?    Do we have to stand there going through the entire menu asking the poor cashier about each item?   How have other people that have been on the dining plan managed this?",snack credits?

If it’s convenient and available, we’d probably check it out, but it’s not really on our radar. 

My question is does Disney do queues or limits for the entire DHS park or would it just be for the Star Wars portion of the park? I visited Islands when Harry Potter opened and happened to get there early enough to do everything without much of a wait and found out later in the day there was a line/capacity limit to get into that section of the park.

I have everything set fp wise, but I do need help with time management wise. I have 4 days I'm concerned about. The rest are filled with other things and one day at Epcot. I feel like these 4 days are just wasting days to do nothing, and I want to maximize my time there. I feel like there are soo many experiences I could put in these days. But I also feel like I am already planned out even if the plans contain nothing.

Day I arrive- nothing planned. Should I plan something? I was just going to enjoy the resort, but maybe I'm missing out.

Day 2: one lunch dining reservation- then nothing. Should I go somewhere?

Day 3: Epcot all day

4th day- AK all day

5th day- just hotel chilling, but I wanted to turn it into an AK day maybe because this day I am staying at AKL, but then I miss the hotel activities at a hotel I paid a lot to stay at.

6th day- last day, disney springs.

I guess I am struggling to know if I should drop one day at the hotel I'm staying at in favor of an onsite one on the 4th day and switch epcot day to that day and get a onsite hotel that night. On the other hand, if i'm barely there, does it make sense to even get another hotel?

DisneyWorld,,Did our fast passes yesterday and made a spread sheet! Let me know what you think of our plans!
DisneyWorld,"Hi! Glad to have found this sub.

My family is going on a cruise at the end of Aug and one of the ports is Port Canaveral. We'll take a bus through he cruise line to Disney for the day. It will be a short day but we're doing it because we're not sure when else we'll be able to take the kids to Disney.

I need help. We'll be going to WDW on Aug 26. All I know is that I need to reserve our fast passes tomorrow. My kids are 5.5y and 3y. I think our plan is to just do Magic Kingdom for the short time we'll be there. It's my husband and me, two kids and my in-laws.

We didn't buy tickets yet (waiting to hear back from a Disney credit card through Chase so we can save $250). I'm nervous we won't be able to buy Tix to get our fast passes in time. 

Should I be worried? Will it be okay if I buy our tickets and do fast passes a few days from now (instead of tomorrow, 30 days prior to our visit)?

If you don't mind, I'm also looking for advice here:
- Be Our Guest buffet w/characters has been booked for weeks. Any other ideas for lunch?
- if you had one partial day to do Magic Kingdom, what would you do (is it's a small world worth it)?

DisneyWorld,"Hi guys! Me nor anyone in my direct family has ever been to Disney World, so I really didn't know where to ask this question. I hope you guys can help!

My dad grew up poor and has been poor most of his life. He's never been to a theme park of any sort, but has always been fascinated by them. I see him all the time watching shows and documentaries based on the rides and the environment of these parks and he often talks about rides he would like to try if he ever got a chance. Disney is one of his favorite places to talk about, but he always laughs it off as a dream that will never happen. About 18 months ago he got sick. We spent months in and out of the hospital. His life expectancy isn't great now with even his most optimistic doctor giving him six years at this point. He's mostly stable these days and keeps himself pretty active despite the outlook. I checked with his doctors and he said it wouldn't make anything worse to take him, so I've decided that I'm going to use a large portion of my savings to take him, my mom, and my two 14 year old sisters for a seven day trip.

I've managed to plot out where we're going to stay and what rides to focus, but have come to a complete stop on food and tours. There are so many restaurants to choose from that I don't even know where to begin and I think he would enjoy most of the tours, especially the behind the scenes ones but with the length of some I doubt we could do them all.

DisneyWorld,"This is embarrassing, but I've rode The Haunted Mansion over 10 times and I still get scared at some parts. I'm going on a trip soon and I want to get over being afraid of a Disney ride. Don't get me wrong, I love the ride and its 999 happy haunts, but I still can't help feeling scared. Spoilers about the ride ahead. The 2 major things that scare me are:

1. The Stretching Room. Something about not being safe in a ride vehicle freaks me out. And the sudden darkness and screams are unsettling. But the scariest part is the cast member accompanying the group. They move around the room sometimes with the intention of being sneaky and startling guests. 

2. The graveyard scene. I'm worried about the pop-up/blast-up ghosts. They are neon and make a loud, startling noise when they come out. It makes me jump. Sometimes the ride stops to load handicapped people, and I am terrified of being stopped while in this scene.

I wondered if any one had any tips on how to avoid being too scared of The Haunted Mansion. It would make my ride experience more enjoyable and comfortable. Thanks if you read this far!

TL;DR - I'm scared of the Haunted Mansion, particularly of getting startled by sudden things. Any tips?",Any tips for not being scared on The Haunted Mansion?

DisneyWorld,"**This was originally posted on a separate sub, but I was encouraged to share this here, especially with hurricane season right around the corner. If you find yourself with a rendezvous in Orlando with a hurricane, the information here may serve useful!**

**Introduction:**

The purpose of this post is to provide a bit of insight into what Disney did for the guests during Hurricane Irma. This was largely considered to be the most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded and it caused Disney to close the Walt Disney World parks for two straight days for the first time in history. I’m not going to go into all of the details of my trip because we all know Ohana is amazing, Flight of Passage is the best ride on property, and that Walt Disney World is a cool place.

----

**The Week Prior:**

This trip consisted of four guys in their late 20’s. We all went to Purdue University and met in the marching band there. At the time of this trip, two of us live in Indiana, one in Minnesota, and the last in New Hampshire and none of us had any experience with hurricanes.

The hurricane emerged less than a week before our trip and we decided to go through with the trip based on a few factors:

1. We booked our hotel with [David's Vacation Club Rentals](https://www.dvcrequest.com/) and as a result, we could not get a refund on our hotel room. You get great deals there, but it comes at a risk
2. Two of us had Annual Passes, so no refunds were available there, either
3. The uncertainty of the hurricane meant that we could just wind up cancelling our trip for no reason
4. Disney World is arguably the best place in Florida during a hurricane

We had food delivered to our room through [Garden Grocer](https://www.gardengrocer.com/) (including beer), I packed some bottles of water and a bottle of whiskey, and we had a bunch of tabletop games and a deck of cards to help keep us occupied. If we were going to get stuck in our room, we made sure we would be entertained during that time.

----

**Thursday - Arrival:**

Three of us arrived on different flights around the same time and we met outside of the Magical Express area. My flight had only about 50 people on a 137 passenger plane. When we got onto the Magical Express, it wasn’t a coach bus like they normally use. It was around 8 PM and they transported us in a 15-seater van.

We arrived at the Beach Club and met a couple who came to Disney World from the coast to wait out the storm. This is routine for them. They come to Disney World for hurricanes. Over the course of the weekend, we would see many more people (identified by their dogs since the pet restriction was lifted for the hurricane) that were doing the same thing. I have pictures of dogs, but I did not get permission to share them, so I will not be doing so.

----

**Friday and Saturday - First Two Park Days:**

This trip sort of spoiled me because the crowds were so light. The longest line we waited in was for Flight of Passage and that didn’t exceed an hour. For everything else, the wait time was essentially the time it took for us to walk through the queue. It was honestly amazing. We got the notification that the parks would be closing for two full days AND nighttime shows on Saturday were cancelled at some point on Friday afternoon. Even with two days lost, we were still able to easily fit in every ride and show we wanted to do thanks to the minimal lines.

The biggest disappointment was in the loss of *three* nights of nighttime shows. Between that and Tuesday’s Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party, that meant we had time for only one regularly scheduled nighttime show. We ultimately decided on Illuminations due to persisting rumors of its replacement and Happily Ever After will be around the next time we each visit.

We didn’t realize that Illuminations was at 10 PM instead of 9 on the Friday until we got there, so we probably could have fit both Happily Ever After and Illuminations in, but it was too late at that point. Instead, we decided to wait for only 30 minutes to ride Frozen Ever After.

Saturday was more of the same. We started in Animal Kingdom, rope-dropped Flight of Passage (along with everyone else in the park) and then crammed everything in by lunchtime, then we head on over to Hollywood Studios to do the same. After we were done there, we walked over to Epcot and knocked out some of the Future World rides.

The amount of things we were able to fit into those two days was astonishing. It’ll be hard to go back and sit in any line for longer than 30 minutes now.

----

**Sunday and Monday - Disney World is CLOSED!**

I don’t remember how we heard about this, but Cape May Cafe was offering breakfast buffets for $15 per person. I believe this was normally a character breakfast with Minnie, but Minnie was too busy hanging out in the Beach Club lobby all day to visit us during breakfast. Our server was a woman who normally works at Beaches and Cream, but was brought in to help at Cape May Cafe. The buffet was like any other full buffet and it was a great value. Things started off the right way on this Sunday.

One of the cast members in the Marketplace also showed me her copy of the [Yacht/Beach Club entertainment and dining schedule](https://imgur.com/a/ic9c3). This album is a little incomplete, but you get the idea. [Goofy, Donald](https://imgur.com/a/DAWr7), and Pluto all joined Minnie  in [entertaining](https://twitter.com/Danulas/status/910305854980853760) and interacting with guests *the entire time* and frankly were all [absolutely amazing](https://twitter.com/Danulas/status/910309383036424192). I cannot overstate how fantastic they were with everyone. Endless energy, impeccable charisma and character. They were wonderful. I’ll never forget it. I don’t think I’ll ever have a better interaction with a character than the one I had with Pluto Sunday afternoon and there was no Photopass Photographer there to capture it.

It wasn’t until Sunday night at about 10:00 PM that Disney started telling us to stay in our rooms. It had rained most of Sunday, but the wind didn’t really pick up until much later. I took the opportunity to mix up the scenery from time to time. I’d spend some time in the Beach Club lobby chatting with the Cast Members in charge of guest entertainment (they were all full-time lifeguards at the Beach Club pool), some time in the Yacht Club lobby where I got a picture with [Captain Hook](https://i.imgur.com/DbVz67n.jpg), and some time in our room where we’d drink, play board games, and watch TV.

TV fell into two categories for us:

1. NFL Network. Since the major networks were covering the hurricane, we couldn’t watch regular season football.

2. The Pay Per View Disney Movie channel. They had this free during the hurricane, but we quickly discovered that it was on a short loop of about 4 or 5 movies and didn’t keep it on for that long.

Anticipating an inability to leave our rooms, we decided to grab some bagels and sandwiches from the Marketplace on Sunday for Monday morning and afternoon.

The wind and rain *really* picked up overnight. I was still awake at about 12:30 AM and the rain hitting our balcony door was quite loud during gusts of wind. Eventually I fell asleep and the four of us largely slept through the whole thing. Being utterly green to hurricanes, I didn’t want to get too close to the window to take a peek outside. Even if I did, I suspect it would have been too dark to really see anything.

The lockdown lasted until about 11 AM. We hung out for a bit and stepped outside at around noon to check things out. There were a lot of people out and about walking around. I took a bunch of [pictures of debris and uprooted trees](https://imgur.com/a/bYrNc) from earlier that morning. There was some minor flooding here and there, but nothing too serious. We walked out to Hollywood Studios and were turned back before we could get too close. We wound up walking all the way around the Boardwalk lagoon and were outside for about an hour. We spent that day doing more of the same as the day before. Through chatting with some of the cast members there, we got a bit of an insight to how they were treated during this whole ordeal:

* They were put into rooms in the Beach Club and fed during the time they were at the resort
* They were on the clock the entire time they were there, including when they were asleep. The one CM we talked to the most ended with 59 hours over those 3 days
* They were paid double-time

Disney certainly took care of the Cast Members that spent their time assisting and entertaining guests during those few days.

The food options within the resort were a little different than the day before. Instead of a sit-down buffet, they offered a to-go box that you could fill up and take with you back to your rooms. On Monday night, they had re-opened a few restaurants on the Boardwalk and we decided to eat at Trattorio Al Forno. Instead of their regular menu, they offered a family style dinner with garden salad, caprese salad, seafood risotto, pizza, and dessert. Unfortunately, they were run on a skeleton crew, so portions were limited (I think we were lucky to get extra caprese) and it ultimately wasn’t a great value. The change of scenery was really appreciated, however, and it certainly beat waiting in line for the counter-serve pizza right next door. Thankfully, the Ample Hills Creamery was also open so we were able to get some extra dessert. When walking back to our hotel after getting ice cream, we witnessed the [most stunning rainbow](https://i.imgur.com/BgCHunK.jpg) I have ever seen in person.

The rest of Monday was uneventful and we got to bed fairly early to get ready for another jam-packed day in the parks.

----

**Tuesday and Wednesday - The Remainder:**

The parks were back open on Tuesday and we got back into it by rope dropping Flight of Passage for the second time that trip. Our priority for the day was hitting up Food &amp; Wine Fest, but since the World Showcase didn’t open until 11, we decided to start our day at Animal Kingdom. The parks were still pretty empty and we managed to hit up every stand at Food &amp; Wine Fest then went back to our hotel to get ready for Mickey’s Not-So-Scary Halloween Party. We were originally planning on attending on Sunday, but we rescheduled to Tuesday at guest services in Magic Kingdom on Friday. It was a pretty painless process. By the time we got to them, the agent had done this transfer so many times that it took mere minutes to get it done for all four of us.

The Halloween Party is amazing and I could dedicate an entire post to just the party. The park felt a bit more crowded than the rest of the time we were there. Rides were still empty, but character meets had about a 20 minute wait, at least for the ones I waited for (Donald/Daisy, and Tigger/Pooh/Eeyore). I didn’t get a good look at some of the exclusive ones like Jack and Sally.

Wednesday again was more of the same, only this time we each flew out that day. We spent most of the day at Hollywood Studios because the rides there are so fun. We walked onto Rock n Rollercoaster 3 times in a row and continued to try to push our high score in Toy Story Midway Mania.

----

**Wrap Up:**

Ultimately, it was an excellent trip. Beach Club was the *perfect* choice. I couldn’t imagine being anywhere else but the Boardwalk area during a hurricane. The variety of scenery we had available to us in the whole Boardwalk area was amazing. 

The light crowds due to people cancelling trips meant that we had some of the most pleasant and memorable park trips we may ever have.

I was impressed by how Disney fed and entertained guests while we were stuck in our hotels. Unfortunately, I can’t speak for those who weren’t at places like Beach Club that have all rooms in one building (aka resorts like All-Star where room doors open to the outside instead of a hallway), but what they did for us was very nice. There will be naysayers that complain about the food choices and whatnot, but I was pretty satisfied all things considered.

I am thankful we had the foresight to procure ways to entertain ourselves during the lockdown (board games and alcohol). It would have been far worse without them. We were getting a little stir crazy by Monday night.

I won’t say that I’ll be looking specifically to book a trip when a hurricane is looming, but if one just so happens to be hitting Orlando when I’m at WDW again, you can be certain I’ll wait it out there instead of cancel just like I did during this trip.

Just for fun, here’s a list of things I got to do for the first time:

* Rock N Rollercoaster - 10/10 loved it
* Tower of Terror - Drops aren’t my cup of tea, but the effects leading up to the drops are amazing
* Trader Sam’s - This place was super cool. I’m looking forward to going back
* Ohana - 10/10 loved it
* Mission: Space - Survived Orange, but I’m not itching to get on it again
* Abracadabar - Cool interior and good, old-fashioned drinks, but otherwise nothing all THAT special
* Stay in a Boardwalk area hotel - These 3 might be the best on property by virtue of what’s available within walking distance. We visited the ESPN Club twice, Ample Hills creamery twice, Trattoria Al Forno, and Abracadabar. Thursday night, we could see both Illuminations and the Star Wars fireworks from the Boardwalk while we walked over to the ESPN Club. It was a really cool experience.
* Survive a hurricane - I knew going in that it might be stressful or difficult, but at least I’d come away with an interesting story. You don’t hear of too many people that willingly fly into the path of the most powerful Atlantic storm ever recorded.

Okay hear me out.

I was listening to a podcast this morning and they started talking about how Test Track is now absolutely horrible and needs to be demolished because #1 you can't re-theme it with a space theme beside Mission Space and Space 220 restaurant and #2 there is no way to introduce IP's to the ride.

That really got me thinking and please don't judge my really sloppy artwork, I'm no artist. Imagine a Space Base on the moon. This can go a few different ways from here.

1. Moon Rover Test Track- This would be similar to the old test track theme with crash test dummies and road hazards. We would be testing out moon rovers on various terrain. Then a speed test around a moon crater (imagine around the rim of the crater).
2. Space Base Tour- This is an AI driven car that will take you on a tour of the Moon Base. Midway during the tour, something glitches with the AI and it starts taking you off course and eventually breaks out of the space base and goes straight for the crater. An operator manages to take back control and bring you back safely to the base. You could possibly introduce some of the Wall-E IP's into this theme. Maybe have a robot in the front of the car (imagine R2D2 in a fighter or E.T. in a basket) controlling the ""tour"".
3. Moon Construction Site- You are a new hire working on building the Moon Base. You would be driving through construction sites (cones, cranes, scaffolding). You are tasked with examining the crater or something outside. The car starts having mechanical issues (losing lights, power surges, leaking oxygen) and you need to book it back to base and the quickest way without losing speed would be to drive around the crater. ( I acknowledge that this idea needs work)

This would definitely require a large amount of re-theming, and to build a building/dome around the outdoor portion of the track. But it's gotta be less expensive than demolishing and building something new.

Thoughts or any other ideas?

I have an AP so I automatically get 60 day FP+ window, but everyone else will have flexible date tickets. How do I go about enabling the 60 day FP+ window for Disney springs hotels? What information do I need from my hotel reservation and how do I add it to MDE? I already have my family tickets added and accounts all set up.",60 day fastpass+ for Disney springs

DisneyWorld,"My wife, 9-yo son, and I want to ride Flight of Passage. My 5-yo son is technically tall enough, but he's scared of a lot of rides that he's technically tall enough for. For reference, he passed out on Slinky Dog Dash. 

For Seven Dwarfs Mine Train, they said we couldn't do child swap because he is tall enough to ride. Does that same rule apply to FoP? Or can we possibly wait in line together and do a child swap at loading? We don't mind waiting together, but I just want to sit with my 5-yo while my wife and 9-yo ride, and then I ride alone when they get off.",Flight of Passage child swap?
DisneyWorld,"I’m stressing out, slightly to my own doing.  This is my wife and I’s second trip to WDW and this time includes my 4y/o daughter’s first experience.   We are also splitting the time up and doing 3 days at Uni.

I remember last time going insane trying to make reservations and planning FP+ times, though I made it all get smoothly together.  However, this time I can’t simply make it work.  We are doing 2 days at Magic Kingdom and 1 day at Animal Kingdom.  My wife booked be our guest for dinner one day6:55 and a Tony’s restaurant experience for lunch 12:15 on the other.  The problem really becomes where Tony’s is located inside the park.

I’m trying to split the park into two days 1 day Tomorrowland and Fantasyland the other  Adventureland and Frontier land.  All of that being said I’m banking on LM Voyage being a small line as the park opens our first day.  I also seem pretty stuck itinerary-wise  in trying to put the Haunted Mansion in on Frontier/Adventureland.

I’m currently going insane moving FP+ around and I think I’m just making it worse.

Thanks for letting me rant, if anyone has any advice I’m more than willing to listen",The Mouse Has Left Me Brain Damaged
