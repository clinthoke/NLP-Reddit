UniversalOrlando,"Alright guys - my first trip to Orlando is in September as per the title. 

Now I‚Äôve saved for a while for this and booked everything separate (staying at the Mouses house, their tickets are sorted and flights are sorted.) 

So all that‚Äôs left is universal tickets - couple of questions! For my U.K. homies, does the 14 day explorer let us on Hogwarts express? Where‚Äôs the best to grab my tickets without getting my eyes ripped out? If I buy a ticket voucher, can I link that to the app? If I link it to the app ASAP, does that mean my tickets will run out when I go? 

(Of course, any other miscellaneous universal / Florida advice is welcome and I love you for it.) 

Cheers!!",First Orlando trip September!

UniversalOrlando,"Hi,

I booked for September. After years of telling people ‚Äúif I‚Äôm traveling to Orlando, it‚Äôs for A WDW trip‚Äù, I finally booked a vacation to give it a try. (I go to WDW every year)

For someone completely clueless when it comes to how universal Orlando works compared to Disney, what should I know?

What are the places I should be wanting to eat at? I‚Äôll be there for 4 days.
Should I be eating more at city walk, or more at the in-park restaurants?

Does dining need to be reserved early like at Disney?

How are crowds compared to Disney?

Are express passes actually worth it for a party of 2, even just for one day? (Especially since parks are open longer than Disney parks each day)

Is there benefit to showing up an hour early when staying at their hotels, even with a 12AM park close?

Anything else experienced folks think i should know?

Thanks!","First time visitor, long time Disney-goer. What to know?"
UniversalOrlando,"So me and my girlfriend both have the ""Seasonal"" Passes. We are wanting get the ""Preferred"" Pass. Would it be cheaper to upgrade, or is it the same price to just buy a new pass? 

The issue we are having with upgrading, is that they were bought for us as a gift and the park told us that the buyer has to be there, in person, in order for us to upgrade. Unfortunately, they can't come to the park anytime soon. Thanks in advance for y'all always helping.",Annual Passes
UniversalOrlando,"Hey everyone,

This is probably more of a Trip Advisor post, so if it doesn't belong here, feel free to remove it, but it is info I would have loved to see before our trip!

My GF and I (late 20's) just spend 3 days at Universal on Monday (Presidents Day in US/Family Day in Canada), Tuesday and Wednesday, Feb 17-19. I had done a bit of research before coming about how busy the Presidents day week was and didn't find much so I thought I would write a quick trip report. 

We bought the 3 day/3 park pass which was 304.99 at the time we bought it. We spent the first 2 nights at ""Rosen Inn Closest to Universal"" which was extremely cheap, and honestly was a pretty reasonable hotel with a free shuttle to the parks, although we just used Uber for convenience ($8). The stretch of I-Drive it's on had a few seedy hotels nearby, but overall it was good value for the money. 

On Monday (the holiday) we went to Volcano Bay and I was concerned the parks would be packed, but I guess I didn't consider that it was ""winter"" for the locals, but it was a perfect temp for us Canadians. Managed to ride the aquacoaster twice before there was any wait and rode every ride we wanted to in the park without any significant wait. This isn't a VB review, but, what an amazing park! We left VB around 5pm and decided to head into IoA for a walk around to get our bearings for the next day, when we arrived the wait for Hagrids was 75 minutes so we jumped in line and got a night ride with less than an hour wait!

We spent the 3rd night at Loews Royal Pacific on site. Everyone suggested this in order to get the Express Passes, but when I saw the price was nearly $600 CAD for one night I almost completely ignored it. However, some quick math showed me the EP's were nearly $150USD per person, per day, which totals $600USD or $800 CAD, so the hotel became a huge steal! We ""checked in"" to the hotel at about 8am on Tuesday morning in order to get our EP's and they had a very good and secure system for holding your bags, all this took about 15 minutes. Got the water taxi into the parks and used our EP's to ride almost everything we wanted to in IoA and then went back to the hotel around 3 to actually get our room. The room wasnt quite ready, but that was fine because we grabbed our swim stuff from our bags, spent 2 hours by the pool and enjoyed a Pina Colada! Again, this is not a hotel review, but wow RP is a beautiful resort.

The next morning we got up early and used our EPA to check out Diagon Alley while it was nearly empty, and we ate breakfast at The Leaky Cauldron almost by ourselves! We rode Gringotts and then made the 5 minute trip back to RP to check out and they again checked our bags for us (we thought going back and forth would be a hassle, but the 5 minute boat ride is lovely and easy). Went back into the park and finished what we wanted in Studios and then went back to the hotel to get our bags and pick up our rental car from AVIS right in the lobby (so convenient)!

Wait Times:

We had EP, but as near as I could tell, in the mornings and evenings most rides were between 30-60 minutes, and during the afternoon not much seemed to be more than 90 mins, except for maybe between 2 and 4pm. The obvious exception is Hagrids, which we were so lucky to get on the first night, because it was delayed/closed/3 hour waits the whole rest of our time there!

I remember in 2012 FEI hosted an event at Islands of Adventure that my family got to go to and it was super limited attendance + all of the food was included. We rode Forbidden Journey 6 times, drank free butterbeer, and had an incredible time. It was one of my favorite Florida memories. 

BF has waited 20 years to go to Universal Orlando Resort. It's been a bucket list item of his. I am wondering if I should just splurge on this event for him plus it works out because we will already be at the parks this day, and he really wants to go a second day.

UniversalOrlando,"My S.O. and I are Premiere Annual Pass holders, and we live an hour away so we come very often. We love the parks and it‚Äôs an amazing escape. Let me start with this, my S.O. Has inner ear problems. Normally roller coasters and loud music isn‚Äôt too bothersome for him, but very high pitched loud things are war bursting for him, and for normal people it‚Äôs still irritating. As of late we have begun to grow tiresome of the way teenage girls screech on rides. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, if it‚Äôs a scream here and there at appropriate parts than it makes sense. But there has been an onslaught of teenage girls who seem to just be wanting attention. For example, on the Mummy today there was a girl directly behind us who began screaming the moment the cart started moving, before we even got to the ‚Äúget out of here!‚Äù And didn‚Äôt even stop to breathe until the end of the ride. And we were moving probably 5 mph. It‚Äôs obnoxious and ruins the ride for everyone. I understand if you are genuinely scared, but if your THAT terrified to even load onto the ride why the hell ride it? When it‚Äôs a person who is actually frightened we are understanding. But when it‚Äôs a 15 year old girl with her friends or bf and she screams just for the laughs and attention from her friends, with no regard to anyone around her, it‚Äôs infuriating. Is anyone else experiencing this problem?",Really tired of screaming teenage girls.

The timing and money worked out pretty perfectly for us to go, but it‚Äôs a pretty last minute trip and we‚Äôre on a bit of a budget. 

In an effort to save money, we‚Äôve decided not to buy the express pass, but we‚Äôre only going to be there for one day.

UniversalOrlando,"Kinda just picked a tag because it's about everything overall don't shoot me

Long story short: my fianc√© and I are expecting a baby in August. Our original plan was to start trying this summer and go on a trip in November as a babymoon, but obviously that plan is a bust (dealing with an unexpected baby comes with challenges - mostly financial). We're really hoping that by November 2021, when the baby is about 15 months old, we'll be able to afford a trip.

Right now we're torn. He really wants to do a cruise sans baby (because the baby can't really do anything - not even swim - and we'd have to pay fare for it anyway...plus there are sooooo many echoey areas which would be the perfect place for an inopportune meltdown), and I would like to as well, however I'm not entirely sure if I'll feel comfortable leaving the baby with his parents for longer than a weekend just yet (so I think I would prefer to wait until he or she is a bit older for that). I also really want to do Orlando in November 2021 specifically, because that's when the new FB movie is coming out and watching a Harry Potter franchise movie *at* USO is always something I've wanted to do (obviously we'll have to order tickets waaaaaaaay far in advance for that). Obviously I have other reasons for going than that, but that's my reason for wanting to go specifically then, as opposed to a year later or another time of year. He wants to visit Orlando at some point, but he's more keen on the cruise.

I've done both trips so neither is really novel to me. Fun, yes, but not super-crazy ""omg this is so amazing and cool and new"". I only did one ride in the whole place though (Forbidden Journey) so I would like the chance to do more.

Now, here's my question to help us decide: how doable is USO with a 15-month-old baby? And do you have any tips, like sources for a reliable babysitter so we can go see the movie without being ""those people"", or how to best organize the day around naptime? We may or may not be able to convince his parents to come, as his mom is also a huge HP fan and wants to visit the parks. We did passively/not really seriously mention the idea of them tagging along partly to help with the baby if we do go (rides might be more fun, because we could maybe utilize the childswap with them and have each couple ride together instead of riding alone? Unless that's only an option when it's just the parents, in which case I'm not sure how his dad likes rides anyway so he might prefer to just hang back with the baby while the three of us go) and she was receptive, but I'm not sure if that's something we're actually interested in or if the three of us could convince his dad. But maybe that's like, a super invaluable resource and we'd be stupid to say no?

So, lay it on me (nicely please lol). Entirely doable if done properly (even if not 100% convenient), or completely batpoop crazy idea?",Question for the parents: Universal Orlando...with a baby?

About 2 weeks ago we got to go again, but this time hit it for 3 days. The original plan was to include VB but the weather was NOT working for us during out stay for that. That said, we had a blast 3 days in a row, and a lot is due to advice and info I gleamed from this sub.


Day 1 we hit Hagrids first thing and got to ride it without issue, waiting less then 1 hour after ""rope drop"". We also finally got to see the Lights at Hogwarts, which wasn't up the time we went years ago.

Day 2 was rainy, but we still did a lot including FINALLY eating at Mythos. 

Day 3 was going to be VB partially that day, but it wasn't swimming weather, even for us northerners. But it was the FIRST DAY OF MARDI GRAS and we had no clue! We ate, got to see the parade, it was awesome!


At the end of our 3rd day, we altered our tickets to be AP's and we're going to go back for HHN for sure.

UniversalOrlando,"Hey Team Members and Universal Fans, 

As someone who enjoyed visiting the Universal Resort growing up and went to visit during my Grad Bash (Class of 2014 here), it's such a great honor to be a part of the Universal experience I know and love. After getting hired on the 30th of Januarary, I put in my two week notice on the same day at my other (Soon to be former) theme park job, SeaWorld. During my day off I decided to visit Universal as I loved going on Haggrid's and it was a good oppertunity to get familiar with the park's layout while I was there. Since I was assigned to Jurrasic Park and one of their quick service kiosk was closed as part of the construction for the upcoming roller coaster (Possibly doing a retheming when they make the switch to Jurrasic World), from what I've heard from my friends that work at the parks too, they'll have me as part of the Rescue team, meaning whatever restaraunt or food stand needs an extra Team Member, I'm the one who comes to help out.


So my question is to those that went through going to different quick service joints, what was it like to be shift around? Was there a particular place that you liked or hated, did you came across some difficulty when covering someone? How were the hours, and did you get along with other Team Members and Supervisors? This is just so I can see what I can expect for my first few weeks into the parks after orientation, and I do hope to be part of the guest's Universe as they come and see what the Resort has to offer.",Starting my Universal Career next week

UniversalOrlando,"I saw a ""deal"" on facbook for a $99 4 day 3 night stay at westgate. I knew I had to do some bullshit sales pitch, but then I had to pay an extra $100 for ""holiday fees"" for valentines day and presidents day. So I am $200 deep right now and haven't even gotten down there. I know I have to do it on Saturday or Sunday and can't go when I check in or check out to the sales pitch. 

Was wondering if any of you had gone through this pitch and how to minimize your time there. My family and I have annual passes, but my father in law does not- so hoping we can get the cheaper tickets if possible by sitting through the sales presentation as well. 

I work in travel and already have access to RCI, so not sure if that would make them give up on the sales pitch.

UniversalOrlando,"I've been lucky enough to visit Universal Orlando twice, and both times I've managed to do both parks in one day. I'm visiting again with my wife in the first week of March (2020) and wondering if anyone has any tactics on getting around everything? My wife's never been before so I'm keen to maximise our day.

* We can visit on a Tues, Weds or Thurs of the week we're there - is any day particularly better or worse, crowds-wise?

* On those days, Universal is open 9am-8pm, but IoA is only open til 7pm, so it would make most sense to finish our day in Universal park, BUT part of me feels weird starting in IoA and not getting to enter through that iconic Universal archway with the globe, especially as my wife has never visited before... Anyone have any tips on which way around to do everything? My gut feeling is to enter through Universal for the experience, walk straight to King's Cross and get the train straight over to IoA for Hagrid's/other stuff, then get around everything in IoA, and then get the train back some time later in the day to finish off at Universal...but then we probs won't get back to IoA and will therefore likely miss the night time Harry Potter show(s)...Are they worth seeing? 

* We also have the option of going to a VIP evening party on the Friday, which is 5pm-12:30am. Will that be likely to have shorter queues and would 7.5hrs be enough to get around both parks with less guests around? 

* Re. Hagrid's.... Are they still experiencing technical issues? Would it be wise for us to make a bee-line there first to make sure we get a ride? Does it use a virtual line yet?

* I heard there's a 'Cinematic Celebration' show since last time I visited - is that worth ending the day at Universal for? Is it better than whatever the Harry Potter light show at IoA is? Considering we're not HUGE HP fans....

I called Universal, and the agent didn't know when the blockout periods were for EPA on the preferred pass.

Is there really no documentation for EPA blockout dates more than a month or two out?  I don't need to know which parks are open for EPA on which days, but I do want to know whether the EPA benefit would work on a given day for whatever park has EPA.

UniversalOrlando,"Hello everyone,

I visit Universal Studios Orlando once in a few years. We always go 3 weeks.

We always buy a 2 week full pass with hopper and volcano bay. We also visit all of the other theme parks in Orlando.

I always wonder, why the single rider line is a lot of times extremely short. For example: There is a 40/45 minute wait or 60 minute wait for Harry Potter and the forbidden journey. The single rider line is like 5 minutes. The attraction is already a ‚Äòsolo‚Äô attraction. Why would people wait 60 minutes to do an attraction which is already solo, if you can also do it 2/3 times with a single rider line. 

We prwtty much always go single rider because many times, we still sit at least next to one of our family. I also don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm going alone once.

My plan was first thing in the morning to head to universal studios first. Potentially get Rockit and Mummy done on the way to Gringotts. If line isn‚Äôt terrible ride Gringotts, otherwise hop on Hogwarts express.  Check out line for Hagrid‚Äôs, if it‚Äôs terrible think about doing Forbidden Journey otherwise begin moving counter clockwise around IoA. Knock out other rides we want to do as we go around and end up back at Hagrid‚Äôs. See if the line is any better if we haven‚Äôt ridden it yet. Finally ride it or get back on the train. Get back to US and ride Gringotts if we skipped it earlier. Then work our way clockwise around US riding smaller stuff. If we get back to Gringotts and still haven‚Äôt done it yet and the park is still open, ride it then and try to see if we can also get on the train back to IoA and do Hagrid‚Äôs or Forbidden Journey as the last thing.

In checking crowd forecasts, I'm seeing a pretty big discrepancy:

- [Undercover Tourist](https://www.undercovertourist.com/orlando/crowd-calendar/) says 9/10 crowds
- [Orlando Informer](https://orlandoinformer.com/universal/crowd-calendar/) says ""slow""
- [Touring Plans](https://touringplans.com/universal-orlando/crowd-calendar/date/2020-01-20) says 8/10 crowds

- [Is It Packed](https://www.isitpacked.com/crowd-calendars/universal-studios-hollywood/) says ""Yup, it's packed""

I understand that the 20th is MLK day which is a stat holiday in the USA but I don't know what kind of impact that would have on crowds (we're from Canada).

I've gathered that Hagrid's is the most egregious in terms of lines, so I'm planning to ""rope drop"" that ride first, followed immediately by the Forbidden Journey, with the hopes of hitting those two rides before there are lines so that the rest of the day can be more leisurely. Does this make sense?

As it stands now we haven't purchased express passes but I'm wondering if maybe we should.

UniversalOrlando,"So I was at Islands of Adventure on NYE a few weeks ago and rode Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls for the very first time. This was my fourth time in the park but I had always stayed away from the water rides. It was chilly on this particular day but it wasn't *too* cold so I thought we should give some of them a try since everything else had insane wait times.

We started with the Jurassic Park River Adventure which despite its age was such a cool ride. I'm honestly upset that I had skipped out on this in the past. We rode it three times in a row because the wait was literally nonexistent. I was surprised at how dry we stayed even riding in the second row the last time. We had so much fun on it we decided we would try out something bigger next, Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls. 

We walked over to Toon Lagoon and stood on the bridge overlooking the final drop and watched it a few times, eyeing the size of the splash, and decided that it didn't look too bad and jumped in line. Most of the logs were empty so we figured we could just walk on, which we did. We hadn't realized it yet but we had made a huge mistake. 

The first two drops didn't even get us that wet, and we were saying to ourselves, ""we should definitely do this one again!"" But that all changed when we turned the corner and saw the waterfall halfway up the final lift hill waiting to drench us. As our log started making it's way up the hill it seemed like all hope was lost. 

It only took a few seconds but the anticipation made it feel much, much longer. We got to the waterfall and we got **SOAKED**. It was as if we had all jumped into a cold shower fully clothed. I know you're supposed to get pretty wet on this ride but we were all literally sopping wet from head to toe. The final drop came and it was fun and it sprinkled us a little bit, but that waterfall was just cruel. 

We saw the warning signs outside the ride telling us we would get soaked but we didn't believe them. Lesson learned. I think we spent then next 15 minutes using the giant air dryers outside the ride and had probably rung out a few gallons of water out of our clothes but we still were soaking wet when it was all done. I couldn't believe the mad lads at Universal had made a ride like this.

\---

Overall it was a fun day and we ended up getting to ride just about everything else we wanted to in the park, besides Hagrid's, but after we left that day I hadn't thought much about it or that ride, until today.

I was watching some ride through videos on YouTube reminiscing about the recent trip and when I got around to watching video of Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls I noticed something odd. THE WATERFALL IS SUPPOSED TO SPLIT WHEN YOUR LOG GETS TO IT.

I guess something was broken the day we went because the waterfall never split to the sides and just completely drenched us. I'm sure it would've been nice on a hot summer day but it was pretty chilly on NYE. Oh well, our fault for trying to have fun on the water rides even though it was 60 degrees out. I guess we can say we got a unique ride at least. Hopefully no one else has to go through the waterfall like we did. 

Just thought I'd share this little story because I'm bored and reminiscing on my recent trip and discovered we kinda got screwed. lol

**TLDR**; When I was at IoA a few weeks ago the waterfall on Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls did not split and me and my entire group got completely drenched from head to toe. After watching some ride through videos on YouTube today I realized the ride was NOT supposed to drench us like that (at least not with the waterfall).",So apparently the waterfall was not operating correctly on Dudley Do-Right's Ripsaw Falls a few weeks ago.

I wear glasses, will I need to get a locker for certain rides?  
Does anyone have a recommendation on a good glasses strap? Contacts aren't an option

I want to bring a fanny pack so I can carry one phone, a hard glasses case, our cards, and some cash  
Do you have recommendations on fanny packs that they will let you wear on most rides.  
What rides are 100 % a no go with a fanny pack

Is there anywhere in the park that we can get an amazing view from up high at night that isn't a ride?

UniversalOrlando,"Hi all.  I am looking for some pointers on going to the resorts.  I have reviewed some threads but am not sure how accurate things are.  My wife and are a both over 30 and planning on going to the park this year as a couple.  It's a bit of a last minute decision.  We are flexible on the dates but would prefer Feb - April.  Our main intention is for Harry Potter related attractions. My questions:

1. In the months above is any period likely to have lower crowds?
2. We want to stay at the park and are debating between the Adventura and the Loews Royal Pacific.  Both seem somewhat more adult friendly (but not sure).
3. Is the Express / Unlimited that comes with the Royal Pacific worth the extra cost?
4. Is three days enough for us to enjoy the park?

Also, should we plan to rope drop the Hagrid ride, or something else? I imagine that's the one ride everybody will be rope dropping since it has no express pass, but what are wait times looking like after rope drop on busy days? Is it still reasonable?

UniversalOrlando,"Just a quick heads up about Universal‚Äôs Best Price Guarantee (found on their park ticket purchase page). It isn‚Äôt exactly price matching, but they do issue a Universal Gift Card for the difference. I found a lower price for park tickets at UndercoverTourist. I purchased my tickets on Universal Orlando‚Äôs site &amp; called Guest Services (407.244.4233, option 4). I provided them with my order confirmation # &amp; UT site &amp; they gave me a reference #. I‚Äôm going to the Guest Services office upon arrival in a few weeks to pick up my gift card. It was very easy &amp; the 10 minutes I spent on the phone is worth the $50+ savings (2-parks for 3 days for two people).

A few notes-
* You can do this in person as well. You can buy your tickets &amp; then go to the parks‚Äô Guest Services office &amp; show them the site.
* The site you use to price match can‚Äôt be one that requires a membership. They were very specific in saying they can‚Äôt match prices if they need to ‚Äúlog in/on‚Äù to a site.
* The site must also be an Authorized Retailer of Universal tickets. 
* The price (&amp; phone call/visit) must be within 7 days. For example-- if you buy your tickets on March 7th, you need to call (or go to their office) within 7 days.
* Screenshots are not acceptable. They must be able to verify the price themselves.
* They match ticket+tax prices.
* There are some additional stipulations for promo ticket packages, so you‚Äôll want to call about those before buying your tickets.
* There is also a [Best Price Guarantee for Vacation Packages](http://www.universalorlandovacations.com/best-price-guarantee) but I didn‚Äôt use this so I‚Äôm unfamiliar with acceptable sites/vendors).

UniversalOrlando,"Hey everyone! So I've been to both Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure a few years back, but there are a handful of rides that I was too scared to go on at the time. I'm going again this week.

Basically I can do almost every ride in the 4 Disneyworld parks. Rock N Roller Coaster is a bit past my limit but I've been on it more than once. The only ride I didn't do in Disney was ToT. Expedition Everest is my favorite, but the part where you go backwards makes my stomach drop so bad that it's probably my limit.

I want to know if I'll be able to handle HRRR and Dr. Doom's Fear Fall. The only thing that bothers me with roller coasters is the stomach drop feeling. I hate the ""I can't control my screaming"" feeling if it lasts too long. I'm assuming this feeling comes from G-Forces? Do HRRR and Dr. Doom have high G forces?

I feel like I could handle the HRRR drop, but I'm not sure how intense the speed will be the rest of the ride. Dr. Doom doesn't look like it has a bad fall, but the slingshot effect makes me think it will feel as bad as Rock N Roller Coaster which I'm not sure I can handle again.

UniversalOrlando,"So I went out to Universal Orlando a few weeks ago specifically to ride Escape from Gringotts and Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure. I obsessively read reviews for wimps on here while waiting in line because I was freaking out. I saw a lot of ""it's not bad at all"" reviews on here but I feel like y'all aren't wimpy enough.

I consider myself pretty high up on the wimpiness scale. I suffer from motion sickness, I can't do inversions because they give me migraines, and big drops make me feel like I'm gonna die. Up until this point the fastest roller coaster I had been on was Slinky Dog, lol

Let me start out by saying I was full of dread and forced myself to go on this ride, and I have no regrets. It was 100% worth it, and I will most likely end up riding it again. If you are on the edge I do urge you to push yourself and try it. That being said, I think a lot of reviews underplay the intensity for a wimp and I think it helps to know what happens. 

**Spoilers ahead**

First of all, this coaster is FAST. Watching the video does not accurately portray how fast it is. 40mph on Slinky Dog was doable for me, but 50mph was much more than I anticipated. I like launches, so the launches are fun. But the curves definitely give you that being crushed feeling, and for a wimp like me it was a pretty intense crushing. Not unbearable, but definitely not something I expected going into it. So be aware of that. 

Another thing to know is that there are very few ""breaks"" on this ride. You are going fast and getting launched like, 95%+ of the time. Reviews will tell you this is a long coaster and it's not over fast, but it did feel over very quickly for me. I wish there were more breaks for me to compose myself but it was bearable since it felt quick. 

There are not any big drops on this ride. So if drops are your only issue you can definitely ride this. The only ""big"" drop was when you stall and end up falling backwards. I was in the second row so I ended up being one of the highest cars up and it wasn't too high at all for me. You end up feeling like you stall out, which I thought was pretty fun. But then comes the backwards part ... This made me REALLY motion sick. I definitely felt like I was going to vom for a little bit. But you only go backwards for a short period and then end up stopping completely, so you have a little bit to compose yourself at the end end.

The free fall was the part I was most scared of going into it. The free fall is short, but I had never experienced the feeling of a free fall before. Honestly, this part is not bad at all. It's quick and probably my favorite part of the ride. Do not fear the free fall. 

I did have neck/shoulder pain coming off of the ride, but it did go away and did not develop into a migraine. If you are a wimp and you are determined to ride, give yourself enough time to ride it twice. I was freaking out and missed a lot of the story/animatronics because of it. But the second time around you aren't freaking out about the unknown and can actually pay attention.",Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure review for ultimate wimps

I have seen all the movies multiple times and will continue to as long as they put them out. But this land is outdated and boring. Sure the rides are fun but who wants to see these characters and theming from the early 1990s anymore?

I feel like Universal only keeps this theming around to keep Disney from using it in their parks. To me that is plain dumb as this land does not draw in the crowds like the other lands and attractions they have at both parks. Obviously people going on these rides but do you really walk through this area and say damn this is awesome ? I mostly say damn I want to ride these outdated properties and get out. 

I also feel it does a disservice to all the fans of the characters who would love to see full feldge lands and rides built based off the new characters at Disney. I do not think getting rid of the marvel comic characters would hurt sales or stop people from coming to the park. So why not update this land to something better?

We were also about to do the Forbidden Journey ride, but when we scanned our ticket to rent a locker, it opened up a locker that was already in use. We decided not to go on the ride, or any other ride for that matter, because we didn't want a stranger having access to our stuff.

UniversalOrlando,"It might be too late to realistically be doing this planning, but I was kind of thinking of taking a trip Feb 14-17 because I get President's Day off, and taking an extra day doesn't hurt too much.

Travel: Air, probably anything I can get with Chase points.

Hotel: Not sure, I know that Disney gives really good perks to stay on their property, but it looks like the only perks might be Express Passes for Universal properties. I have access to Shades of Green on Disney's property, which gives a lot of Disney perks, but also has a shuttle to Universal.

Tickets: Can get them from MWR for cheap.

So the last time I went to a Universal park was 1999 for Islands of Adventure. So pretty much everything is new to me. I'm also super interested in the Harry Potter stuff. If I do this, there's also a part of me that really wants to go to the Star Wars Land at Disney on the same trip.

UniversalOrlando,"Hey everyone! So I have a bit of a weird situation with my park tickets and I was hoping that someone on here could offer some help. 
Back in June my brother, my mom, my aunt, and myself bought tickets for both Universal Studios and Islands, there was a Florida resident deal and it was basically buy 2 days get 2 days with the only restriction being a couple of blackout dates. When we went to the parks in June my brother was the one that got our tickets with our IDs to verify our address and then he passed them out to our little group. The problem is he accurately got his ticket with his name on it, gave my mom her ticket with her name, but switched up mine and my aunt's. In our hurry and excitement to get in we didn't even notice until we got back home after 2 days at the parks. We kept the tickets switched though since we had already used them with our fingerprints respectively.
Fast forward to mid October, we went back to Islands to hang out for a day, my aunt had her (my) ticket and her finger scanned perfectly and then I was up to scan. I put my finger on the scanner and it won't read it. The employee has me try my other index finger and my thumbs and none of them worked. She asked if I had my ID on me and we had to quickly explain that my aunt and I had our tickets switched when we got them but we verified with her that our IDs matched both tickets and they let us through.
Now this weekend, my family is going back to Universal for a birthday celebration and to not lose that last forth day on the tickets. All of us except my aunt. Now the fact that she isn't going isn't really a problem in and of itself, like yes she'd be losing that fourth day but she's chill about it. The foreseeable issue with her not going is if I have any problem with the scanner again. It was easy to explain the last time cause she was there and we could show our IDs, but I'm worried about not having anything to prove that the tickets were accidentally switched and not stolen or anything. 
And so this very long winded and essay of a post is basically just to ask if I should just take the ticket with my name on it (the one my aunt used this whole time) or if I should just use the one I had used or even if I should go to guest services and explain the situation there.

UniversalOrlando,"I'm having some trouble finding answers to some questions I have, so I figured I would try here before sending an email. Here is the deal and a little explanation to give my request more detail and make sense of what I need. A little over a year ago my girlfriend moved from Texas to Florida with our kids. Very shortly before she left I had been saving like crazy to buy a Universal vacation package for us to go to the Harry Potter park, as I had gone many years before I met her. It had been one of the most fun things I had ever done and I wanted our kids to experience it. Her leaving was super sudden and unexpected. It just kind of *happened* one day, and she also took my car so I had to use all my savings on a new vehicle and pay off all the debt she had left me with. This basically shelved any plans I had of getting them into the park...but I still want them to be able to go, even to this day! I know it will make them all very happy.

Years before, she had made a comment that when she read the books as a kid she had desperately hoped that she would get a Hogwarts acceptance letter in the mail; so for a long time I had concocted this idea to have a Hogwarts acceptance letter made up for her with a note that said it had regrettably gotten lost in the mail years ago when she was a kid, and that while she is too old to go to wizarding school now, they have provided all the necessary papers allowing her to tour the grounds and have a wand made, etc along with all the spells and stuff printed on it. You get the gist. In this letter would be the tickets/papers for the vacation plan! :) I know it sounds lame and silly but I still wanna do this for her and our kids.

That is the most important part, the ability to just mail the plan anonymously, though I am sure she will eventually figure out who it is from, I don't want anyone else who might be involved in her life to know.

UniversalOrlando,"I just got back from a 2 day stay in the park and we noticed that the ride queue times didn't match with the ones universal provides. 

I noticed that island of adventure was so crowded they are having to close the walkways between jurassic and hogsmead and that was when I saw Hagrids motorbike wait times go from 240 minutes to 90 minutes.  So I walked over to the motor bikes and saw the queue was backed all the way up to the entrance.  And if you've ridden Hagrids before you know the line for the full queue is extremely long.

I asked the employee out front why they were claiming a 90 minute wait when clearly it's over 200 and she had no answer for me.   I then went out towards hogwarts castle and saw that the crowd was shoulder to shoulder of people wanting to watch the projected light show.    The entire area was at maximum capacity including the bridge to the jurassic area and MORE people were still yet feeding in from The lost continent and the hogwarts express. 


It's clear that universal is having a problem with too many guests.  I suspect they lower the shown wait times for popular rides when they are being over-run with too many people at once. 

Either way the parks are getting too crowded for the space they have.

I'm not a foodie. Not by any stretch of the imagination. Not a big eater at all. However, due to a medical condition I do eat dinner at 5-6pm, and with the hefty price, knowing that ""dinner"" isn't available until 9pm on Saturday makes me think this sucks.

A few questions:

1. We are not foodies; we usually pack food for Disney or amusement parks. I see Universal says ""no picnic lunches"" - what's the deal with what's actually allowed and not allowed? We often pack a mix of crackers, granola bars, etc, plus PB&amp;J sandwiches. Nothing cold; all in a backpack. Any issues with that or would we need to leave the sandwiches out?
2. One son is autistic. In the past, we had a wheelchair for him at Disney and a special needs pass. We ended up not really using the pass since it wasn't very crowded that trip. We are doing a wheelchair at disney again this time - it's mostly a place he can curl up and cover with an umbrella to ""get away"" a little from the chaos and keep from getting overwhelmed; it's not a physical disability that he needs a chair for. Any experience/tips with special needs at Universal? I'm hoping to NOT take the wheelchair to universal, but it's something we'll decide closer to the time once we see how things have been going at the other parks.

First I wanted to say thank you to everyone who was so sweet on my last post about how excited I was for my first trip. 

&amp;#x200B;

I jut wanted to make a follow up post, I was dealing with post vacation blues last week and most of this week so I'm a bit behind posting. 

&amp;#x200B;

I was in universal the week of Halloween and it was pure magic. My hubby and I were there celebrating our 10th anniversary (it was in May) We stayed at the surfside in and it was such a nice place to just chill after long park days. 

Our first day in the park we did the early hours, I wanted to get to Olivanders and maybe get picked of the wand ceremony.  While we waited in line the wizard who greeted us was asking if it was my first trip and just talking to us. I broke down pretty much as soon as I had entered the shop. I've been waiting since they announced these parts of the parks to go (I've never been to Universal or Florida). When we got into the room and Olivander came in he did a once around the room and stopped in front of me. I was shaking so much that I barely remember getting my name out when he asked me. The wand ceremony was everything I could have possibly dreamed of. The wand that I got is for creatives and had a unicorn hair core. I legit started sobbing when he said that (I""m an artist and my art name has unicorn in it. I never once mentioned this when we were waiting in the hall) It was just pure magic for me. His helper after asked me if I was okay because I hadn't stopped crying. We took the train over to Hogsmead and it was picture perfect.  I loved Hogsmead and seeing the castle finally. I will say I think Diagon Alley was my favorite of the two.

The Harry Potter stuff is why I booked the trip but everything in Universal and IOA was amazing! My hubby absolutely loved Poseidons Furry and I did too. I got a coin necklace made at the shop just outside of that, it hasn't left my neck since. One of my favorite memories was convincing my husband to do the Jurassic ride and not warning him of the drop. The picture memory is a keeper. 

Springfield was so much fun and it took a few days before we could get in and really explore it because we kept getting there after they had started closing it for HHN which was fine.  

I did Disney one evening I was there and loved every moment of that.

I live in Europe and I want to buy my brother some Fast and Furious merchandise for Christmas. He‚Äôs autistic and he has set his sights on a couple of items in the online shop. The thing is, I was reading about the cost of delivery and overall, it‚Äôs extremely expensive for me and I‚Äôm not sure I can afford everything he wants but because he‚Äôs autistic, it‚Äôs going to be difficult for me to let him down without him spiralling. Due to how much he loves the franchise (you‚Äôve no idea!), I can try and scrape by and order him at least one thing.

it's based off the hotel in the game, with the each floor having a different theme (except floors 3 through 5, cause those are just based off regular hotels for the ones who want a common room for a cheap price) to it based off the ones in the game and with something special on each floor (like different chain restaurants on certain floor), like you can have the Castle Floor have an indoor medieval playground, the Movie Studio floor have a mini-movie theater to it where it plays old Universal movies, and the Pirate floor having a Bubba Gumps inside the floor (or whatever Seafood restaurant), and the main the gimmick is that at night the hallways goes dim, there's blacklights everywhere, and there are mirrors in the hallways that shows ghosts like the hitchhikers from the Haunted Mansion ride at Disney's Magic Kingdom and each floor has different ghosts on each floor

My 10 year old daughter is autistic and ridiculously afraid of bugs of ANY kind. We told her a million times they're harmless but she wasn't having it. So the solution in her mind was to wear a rain poncho. We opened up the sides to allow for some kind of air flow as it was a thousand degrees.

We stopped by the Knight Bus to get a picture and when it was our turn the shrunken head said to my daughter ""I don't know if you know this, but your invisibility cloak is NOT working."" We all had a good laugh and it actually got her mind off the bugs for a few minutes.

UniversalOrlando,"Hey everyone!

So I just planned a Spring Break trip, staying at Cabana Bay from March 16th-March 20th with three other people. One of them will have just turned 21 right before we leave, so we're spending the week celebrating her birthday. She is a MASSIVE Harry Potter fan (she cried when she found out Universal has Hogsmeade AND Diagon Alley) and has never been to Universal before, so I'm trying to think of ideas to make this trip really special for her. We can't shell out a ton of extra money (the other three of us are pooling funds together to buy her an interactive wand) so things like Shutterbuttons or buying her a full set of robes are, unfortunately, out. The ultimate dream would for her to get picked for Ollivander's but I know that's usually by chance!

So if anybody has any ideas on how to celebrate her 21st birthday, her first trip, AND her love for Harry Potter, I'd love to hear them! Non-HP birthday ideas are welcome as well, as we're trying not to spend our entire trip JUST in the Wizarding World, haha. We'll also be there for Mardi Gras!",21st Birthday Trip Ideas?

UniversalOrlando,"-Team Members are there to help you and make sure you have the best theme park experience. If you need anything/ have any questions, Just walk up to one of us. There's no stupid questions and your not wasting our time. 



-If you need something in a quick service restaurant and the line is long; Ask the busser. Sadly they can't give you free pizza's, but they can get you cups of water, straws, etc. 




-Keep your refillable cup receipt. Sometimes the cups like to stop working.... It makes it a lot easier if you show us the receipt so we can fix it for you. 




-Don't qoute me on this, but Hagrids typically closes before 5 PM. They cut off the line around 3 (depending on the wait time though. so if the wait time is 3 hours and it's 2 PM, they will probably cut off the line ASAP). 



-Look up the park hours before you actually get to the park. Because of HHN, The times are wonky right now. 



-This isn't really a thing but I think it's polite. If you know someone who hangs out with a character, please don't go up to them like ""Hey! Is David in there""? Just ask the attendant if your friend is hanging out with the character at the moment. The attendant will probably tell the character something like ""Hey ***insert character here***! Your friend Steven is here to say hi""!  



-At Vanity Ball, the characters all have names. I know the female announcer is Madame, and the girl that holds the severed head is Amanda, and the head is Lucy. Panini is the girl with the total face transplant and giant blonde hair. It would be too much work to list all of their names lol. 



-There's no special way to get free stuff, but team members will be more willing to help you out if your nice. Its a common sense thing, Like if you yell at someone why would they help you out? 




-Rain in Florida is weird, most of the time it just rains for like 10 minutes then goes away. But there are times where it rains all day or for a couple hours. Make sure to check the weather before you visit the parks. 




-There's tons of stuff to do if it rains, so don't let that get you down. Just ask a TM if they know of some fun things to do while waiting out the rain. 




-(This applies to Disney too)- We have some rooms in the first aid building that are meant for mothers to breastfeed. But if You have other health concerns (I.e anxiety) they will let you chill out in a quiet room for a little bit. Disney has them in their guest relations buildings, along with their first aid buildings, and we just have ours in the first aid buildings.

All that said, I've Googled/searched the subreddit for info on the hotel discounts. I get that the actual discount you get is based on season. I had some more questions though and thought maybe some of you'd know. 


1- Does tier of Pass matter, or do all AP holders get the same discounted rate (based on season)? Meaning does a Seasonal Pass holder get a lesser discount than a Premier Pass holder on the same day? Or does 2 Park vs 3 Park matter on the discount?




2- What are the discounts like overall? Do you find them worth it? I get that's kind of loaded, because really the AP is ""worth it"" based on how many days in that year you actually get to the parks. But overall, are they generally pretty weak or can they be real life savers? Again I get the time of year factors in, so what's been your best case and worst case discounts (worst case not including NO discount, clearly that's the worst.)

UniversalOrlando,"when we were planning our first universal trip, this community was super helpful. hopefully this will help other people, too! 

we went for five days and i don‚Äôt think we needed that many. i think 3 would have been totally fine. it was a super good time of year to go. we didn‚Äôt experience any rain (like NONE. not one drop.) and the lines weren‚Äôt bad at all. the first day i was hell bent on getting there right when the park opened...but that was the last day we did that. we found that we only really wanted to be in the park for about 5/6 hours max so the rest of the trip we slept in and then rolled up to the park anytime between 11 and 3 depending on the day. we got to ride hagrids ride 3 times which was awesome. it truly is the best ride ever. the app said the wait was like 180 mins but i think the longest we waited was like an hour and the shortest was like 10 mins. we did notice that they always shut down the ride around 3:30 everyday so try to get there before then. harry potter was our main focus so we made sure to explore every inch we could. i liked the food at the leaky cauldron more than the three broomsticks. butterbeer was alright. i wish we would have been around for the hot butterbeer but oh well. pumpkin juice was A+. we spent a whole day picking out our wands and then trying every spell on the map. one of my favorite things was staying for the dark arts at hogwarts (which starts at sun down). it was the coolest thing. make sure you stick around and interact with the death eaters. 

as for non harry potter things, the rides that we loved were: the hulk, jurassic park, dudley doo right, AND THE MUMMY. we rode the mummy like 8 times. so good. the simpson‚Äôs world was also pretty neat. we also did one night at HHN. went into ghostbusters, us, and stranger things. we didn‚Äôt get an express pass, but i don‚Äôt think we needed it. we only stayed for a few hours because we were tired but i think we could have stuck around and made it to all of the houses without an express pass.

we also really dug the chocolate emporium at city walk! margaritaville can eat my shorts though.

I haven‚Äôt been on every ride at UO, but probably 2/3 of them. My bottom 3 are

1. ET: I went in with an open mind, but this was the only ride I got very bored on. It‚Äôs too slow and there‚Äôs no thrill. Not a fan of the movie either, so there was no nostalgia attached to it. IMO it should be drastically updated.

2. Men In Black: also very dated. Will Smith‚Äôs charisma can only do so much. The animatronics were uninteresting to me and the whole shooting aliens thing didn‚Äôt do it for me. Pass.

3. Simpsons: This one was okay. I‚Äôm not a Simpsons fan, but I enjoyed the roller coaster aspects of this one. I was sitting on the end of the row, and the side of the car was in the way of the screen, which took me out of it a little. Still a decent ride, but I wouldn‚Äôt ride it again.

UniversalOrlando,"I'm heading to a heavily-scheduled 8-day Disney resort vacation in mid-November. 5 day park hopper pass, I want to hit Universal as well! I bought a 1-day 2-park ticket to Universal, have it in my email inbox. If I don't hit everything I want, I have a day in my schedule to fit a second Universal day if I need it.

I'm assuming I can pick up a second day ticket if I need it in this relatively slow season? Other than that, is there anything I need? I'm new to this, and with all the pre-planning that Disney has me doing I'm a little nervous that I'm just going to walk up to the entrance with this emailed ticket and get in? Also I can't quite verify for sure that the ticket I bought will be valid for the Saturday/Sunday I want to go.

I paid $180 for a '2-Park 1-Day Park-to-Park Regular Season' Adult ticket. Will that get me in on Saturday Nov 16th? If I want to go for a second day, will I have a problem getting a ticket for Sunday Nov 17th?",Do I Need To Plan More? 1 Day At Universal
UniversalOrlando,"My first trip to Universal was this week. Lots of rides I loved, but were expected like all the Harry Potter rides, the Hulk, and Spiderman. 

But my biggest surprise was Men In Black. Loved it! Such a fun ride that made me engaged and smile the entire time. Fun story, the interactivity, and the uniqueness, all with practical effects and without screens or 3D glasses as the major part like a lot of the other rides in the park.

With so many rides feeling the same, this one wins for sheer uniqueness and fun.",My biggest surprise was...

UniversalOrlando,"-I'm sure this kind of question gets asked a lot so I apologize in advance-

I'm visiting Florida in January and hoping to visit Universal for the Christmas event before it ends. I've heard that the last week of December is incredibly busy and the closer you get to the end of the event (January 5th) the better the crowds will be because kids go back to school. However, the last couple of days of the event are over a weekend so I'm wondering if it'd be best to go on the 3rd (later, more kids back to school, but maybe busier because it's a Friday) or the 2nd (earlier on so maybe more kids still on break but a maybe less busy because it's a Thursday). 

Thanks so much!


In case it matters, the types of things we are wanting to do are the shows and parades and whatnot. We aren't big on rides so we're mostly just hoping for a day where people in the walkways and buildings aren't packed in like sardines because my mom uses a mobility scooter and she doesn't want to step on any toes (or run them over for that matter üòÇ)",Which day would be less busy?

""Love is Universal""

From the Anti Defamation League:

Note: For reasons explained below, particular caution must be used when evaluating this symbol.

The ‚Äúokay‚Äù hand gesture‚Äîin which the thumb and index finger touch while the other fingers of the hand are held outstretched‚Äîis an obvious and ancient gesture that has arisen in many cultures over the years with different meanings.

Today, in a usage that dates to at least as early as 17th century Great Britain, it most commonly signals understanding, consent, approval or well-being. Since the early 1800s, the gesture increasingly became associated with the word ‚Äúokay‚Äù and its abbreviation ‚Äúok.‚Äù  The gesture is also important in the Hindu and Buddhist worlds, as well as in yoga, where it is known as mudra or vitarka mudra, a symbol of inner perfection.  The ""okay"" hand gesture also forms part of the basis for a number of words or concepts in American Sign Language. It appears in many other contexts as well.

Use of the okay symbol in most contexts is entirely innocuous and harmless.

In 2017, the ‚Äúokay‚Äù hand gesture acquired a new and different significance thanks to a hoax by members of the website 4chan to falsely promote the gesture as a hate symbol, claiming that the gesture represented the letters ‚Äúwp,‚Äù for ‚Äúwhite power.‚Äù The ‚Äúokay‚Äù gesture hoax was merely the latest in a series of similar 4chan hoaxes using various innocuous symbols; in each case, the hoaxers hoped that the media and liberals would overreact by condemning a common image as white supremacist.

In the case of the ‚Äúokay‚Äù gesture, the hoax was so successful the symbol became a popular trolling tactic on the part of right-leaning individuals, who would often post photos to social media of themselves posing while making the ‚Äúokay‚Äù gesture.

Ironically, some white supremacists themselves soon also participated in such trolling tactics, lending an actual credence to those who labeled the trolling gesture as racist in nature. By 2019, at least some white supremacists seem to have abandoned the ironic or satiric intent behind the original trolling campaign and used the symbol as a sincere expression of white supremacy, such as when Australian white supremacist [redacted] flashed the symbol during a March 2019 courtroom appearance soon after his arrest for allegedly murdering 50 people in a shooting spree at mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.

The overwhelming usage of the ‚Äúokay‚Äù hand gesture today is still its traditional purpose as a gesture signifying assent or approval. As a result, someone who uses the symbol cannot be assumed to be using the symbol in either a trolling or, especially, white supremacist context unless other contextual evidence exists to support the contention. Since 2017, many people have been falsely accused of being racist or white supremacist for using the ‚Äúokay‚Äù gesture in its traditional and innocuous sense.

Other, similar-seeming hand gestures have also been mistakenly assumed to have white supremacist connotations as a result of the ‚Äúokay‚Äù hoax. One of these is the so-called ‚ÄúCircle Game,‚Äù in which people attempt to trick each other into looking at an okay-like hand gesture made somewhere below the waist. Another is the hand sign of the Three Percenter movement, a wing of the anti-government extremist militia movement. Three Percenters, who are right-wing extremists but are not typically white supremacists, often make a hand gesture to symbolize their movement that uses the outstretched middle, ring, and pinky fingers to represent a Roman numeral ‚Äú3.‚Äù This gesture, from certain angles, can often resemble an ‚Äúokay‚Äù hand gesture and has been misinterpreted by some as a white supremacist symbol.

Because of the traditional meaning of the ‚Äúokay‚Äù hand gesture, as well as other usages unrelated to white supremacy, particular care must be taken not to jump to conclusions about the intent behind someone who has used the gesture.",A note about the Gru actor and the OK symbol

UniversalOrlando,"TL;DR at bottom

Today (September 27th) we visited both Theme Parks via Park-Hopper Ticket. After a ton of research I opted to attempt to ride Hagrid‚Äôs by using the rope drop/park opening mass stampede method at Islands of Adventure. It was partially successful. (Partially due to malfunctioning pre-ride queue segment).

Park operating hours today were scheduled from 9am-8pm with no extra early hours beforehand. I showed up to the gate around 8:10 am. There were probably 250 or so people out there already, spread across all the entry turnstiles. I managed to secure a spot about 15 people back from one of the turnstiles. By park opening there was easily between 700-800 people lined up (possibly more).

They started letting people in around 8:50ish. I got stuck in a line where the girl working it couldn‚Äôt seem to get anyone‚Äôs finger prints to work, of course, which set us back about 2-3 minutes longer than our surrounding lines.

Once we entered, it was a straight up mad dash back to the coaster. There were park employees stationed here and there along the way telling people not to run, but many folks didn‚Äôt listen, and ran instead to get ahead. They allowed us to run all the way back to the queue (which started in front of Hogsmeade Station). A cast member somewhere near the start of the line there was telling everyone the ride was on a delayed start and wouldn‚Äôt be open for a while and they didn‚Äôt know for how long. We took our chances. 

Fortunately I was near the front of the pack, so I was able to essentially walk the entire line and quickly enjoy the atmosphere. The ride was not actually delayed at all. But the pre-ride ‚Äúshow‚Äù which explained the story right before the loading area was not working, so we didn‚Äôt get to go through that experience. That was quite disappointing to me because I‚Äôm all about the experience.

Anyhow, got right up to the loading station, rode the ride (sit in the motorcycle if you can), got off and was standing in the center of Hogsmeade at 9:12am. So, managed to ride it and finish within the first ten minutes of park opening.

I used the absolutely untouched bathroom, bought myself a butterbeer, quickly buzzed about an empty Hogsmeade and enjoyed the space, then I went to Hogwarts Castle and walked the line to enjoy the immersion. There was zero wait at all but I did not ride, just wanted to see the queue. I then went back to the train station to head over to US to meet my family. At this point it was approximately 9:35am and the line for Hagrid‚Äôs had jumped to 150 minutes.

We wanted to possibly ride it later in the day, so headed back to IoA around 3:30pm (after a 45 min wait at King‚Äôs Cross). When we got off the train the app showed the ride was ‚ÄúAt Capacity‚Äù. I asked a cast member about this and she explained that it means that the line was longer than the rest of the time that the ride would be open for the day. She then told me that in order to guarantee you‚Äôll get to ride it YOU MUST BE IN LINE BEFORE 3pm. 

This didn‚Äôt make sense to me since the park closed at 8p and it was only 3:30p. It wasn‚Äôt THAT busy today that it would have a 4.5hr wait. I realized a bit later after checking the app again that Universal closes that specific ride multiple hours early every day. So the line was at capacity at 3:30pm because they completely closed it for the night at 5pm. 

It is worth noting that for a good few hours 11:30a-2:30p -ish the app had the line listed between 75-90 mins.

At the end of it all, my wife didn‚Äôt get a chance to ride it. Which is a huge bummer. But moreso than that, it‚Äôs really a shame that Universal has pushed the pedal to the floor on their marketing of this incredible coaster, yet is delaying the opening somedays, shutting it down multiple hours early everyday, and cutting line access by 3pm everyday. (The line was also at capacity yesterday 9/26 around 3pm and closed by 5pm according to the app). It was very frustrating to say the least, and I hope they get these issues figured out considering that was the main reason we bought park hoppers.

TL;DR - Rope Drop is essential. Arrive a minimum of 1 hour before park opening and be ready to run. If you don‚Äôt rope drop, don‚Äôt bother going there in the morning. Wait until around lunchtime and pray it‚Äôs not delayed or down. Just make sure you‚Äôre in line before 3pm. Ride closes 3-4 hrs before park close, and they will close the line down multiple hours before that if it gets long enough. 

Hope this helps anyone who needs it!

Because of this, I have had quite a few \~magical memories\~, and one happened the other day and I wanted to tell y'all about it!

We had gone to watch the Dark Arts at Hogwarts Castle show for the first time, and after we did (fantastic show), we rode Forbidden Journey, and then went to go ride Flight of the Hippogriff. If you've never been on Flight of the Hippogriff during one of the nighttime light shows, I *highly* recommend it. The audio is so loud that you can hear it clearly on the ride, and since you're right next to the castle, you get that wonderful glow of Hogsmeade at night, and the ever-changing projections on Hogwarts Castle. We managed to get on towards the end of the show (Don't keep reading if you don't want to be spoiled for the Dark Arts show!) when Voldemort starts speaking to the crowd. Because of this, we rode Hippogriff during a really climactic part of the show -- the visuals were so interesting on the castle, and the music was loud and bustling -- it was so cool to ride through! And right as we hit the break run at the end, the fireworks went right over our heads, lighting everything around Hogwarts Castle. 

It was such an amazing moment, beautiful visuals and a wonderful ending with those fireworks! We were just laughing and talking about how cool it was as we pulled into the station and walked up to Hogsmeade. I know many of us on this subreddit tend to be Annual Pass holders, and we are just so lucky that we are able to go to this park as often as we do and truly get to enjoy and indulge in getting immersed in these lands all the time. Many people wish they could go to Universal, and Disney, even once and we get to go all the time. It's always a great time, and I feel so lucky to be able to have so many fond memories of places like the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. I know that I will remember that ride on the Hippogriff for so long, and I'm sure most people who visit Universal Orlando, whether they have annual passes or go once every few years, have quite special memories as well.",One of My Most Magical Memories

UniversalOrlando,"I‚Äôve been a premier annual pass holder since May and have gone to IoA and Universal 6 times now. My experience so far has been nothing short of amazing and I‚Äôm really enjoying it. Knowing how excited experienced locals get for HHN and my experience with Universal so far, I had extremely high expectations for HHN. 

Being a premier holder I was able to attend HHN at no cost, however I got me and my wife express passes which ran us $275. We arrived right at 5:45 to a massive crowd at the front gates which really just added to my anticipation - people really get excited for this thing.

From 6 to about 10pm we were able to hit every single house. We didn‚Äôt do any of the shows unfortunately. 

As excepted the production value was amazing. The costumes, the props, the themed areas of the park - all awesome. And the vibe at night is so much fun. Overall however HHN was extremely underwhelming. 

Before I dive into why, I want to ask HHN vets how this year stacks up against years past and/or a typical year? 

I think my main gripe is the crowd. The fact they have you walking through these houses elbow to elbow in a straight file line really diminishes the experience. With so many people going through at once, it‚Äôs way too easy to anticipate the scares and that‚Äôs if you‚Äôre even fortunate enough to be the person the actor jumps out to try and scare, which isn‚Äôt often simply because there‚Äôs 50+ people filing through at any one time. 

For me, the best house was far-and-away Us. I think this is because it was the most different. While all other 11 houses relied on people standing around a corner and jumping out at you, Us took a different and refreshing approach. I kept waiting for one of the other houses to do something, anything, different to break up the same formula of actors just jumping at you from hidden corners, but it never happened.

Another buzz-kill was the out-of-character staff quickly, and sometimes rudely, ushering you through each house. Listen, I get it. Universal is a business that wants to make money. But they are so focused on getting as many people in and through these houses as possible in the shortest amount of time possible, it truly diminishes the experience IMO.  

Idk maybe haunted houses just aren‚Äôt my thing. Maybe I should have bought a beer. Knowing what I know now, I would not pay for admission. And I likely won‚Äôt go next year even with my annual pass because the experience would have been terrible without an express pass.

I've looked on the website and found [these rules](https://m.universalstudioshollywood.com/faqs/can-i-bring-food-and-drinks-into-the-park/) which don't seem overly prohibitive except on terms of size.       





It says you are allowed *'small snacks'* which feels quite subjective and also says that you are allowed *'Soft-sided insulated bags no larger than 8.5 inches wide x 6 inches high x 6 inches deep'* which is rather specific. I would take this to mean that each person can bring in snacks that would fit into such a bag.

We have been to Universal Hollywood before a few times but I've read it's quite better in Orlando. We plan on going to Florida in October for the first time and trying to decide what's the best way to go about it. 

She is a HUGE Harry Potter fan so I have to buy the the ticket for both parks so we can have the experience with the train and I want to do horror nights too so we both get to do what we want (heard HHN is better than the LA one)

 We aren't trying to spend a whole lot even though we know it will be pricey but we don't know when we'll ever get the chance to go again. What would would be our best options?

Should I get a 2park ticket 1 Day ticket then do horror nights that same night ? is that possible?

Or

A 2 park 1 day ticket then horror nights the next night?

Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.","We've never been but want to go to Universal Orlando, Island of Adventures and Halloween Horror nights, advice?"

UniversalOrlando,"After months of waiting, and almost 2 years of gradually building hype as I saw the demolition of Dueling Dragons and the construction of it, I got to partake in Hagrid‚Äôs Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure today, at long last. 

And let me say, I was blown away. It‚Äôs an absolutely incredible experience! The detail is wonderful. It‚Äôs also fast and thrilling‚Äî &gt;!it immediately launches you upon leaving the station.!&lt; I was concerned about how well they‚Äôd be able to pull off the &gt;!Devil‚Äôs Snare,!&lt; but I think they did it quite well. I‚Äôll also say that the track is incredibly smooth, which is nice. 

My one and only thinkable gripe with the entire experience would be the main &gt;!Blast-Ended Skrewt!&lt; scene. It goes by way too fast for you to take _anything_ in. The &gt;!Blast-Ended Skrewt!&lt; itself didn‚Äôt look terribly impressive, in my opinion, but I didn‚Äôt really get a good view of it, as we flew past. It appeared to just kinda &gt;!bounce around and spin, though.!&lt;


Still, the entire attraction was absolutely wonderful. It‚Äôs worth the wait. The queue, the architecture, the animatronics (except that one), the track, the launches, the seats‚Äî it was all fantastic. 

One last thing: wait time inflation is apparent. I got in, waited in line, rode the ride, had my moment of awe afterwards, checked out my ride photo, and got my stuff from the locker all within an hour, but the wait time was stated to be 90 minutes.",FINALLY rode Hagrid‚Äôs!!

UniversalOrlando,"Just got back from a great Universal vacation and wanted to give a little short trip report. Just some of the highlights/observations  of the trip. It will be in loose chronological order. Any questions feel free to ask. 

\-Flew in on Sept. 7. Flight was uneventful. We took an Uber to the Resort (Cabana Bay). One thing I did not was the extreme amount of people soliciting rides by the Ride Share/Taxi area at the Airport. I know the Airport I flew out of (Chicago Midway) has strict warnings and rules on that. So as a precaution and warning, if anyone comes up to you soliciting a ride, refuse and go through the proper channels.

\-We stayed at Cabana Bay. Wonderful resort. Had a nice room by the Lazy River. Far down the building but inside hallways make the walk ok. No real complaints on the room (the shower curtain was a little ripped and we had one leaky shower the first day because of it before we adjusted). There is so much at the hotel in terms of food and activities and just space. One of my favorite things about the hotel is the space. Everything is spread out but not so much that it is a trudge to get from one place to another. 

\-Sunday we went to Disney at night so the only Universal activity was going to the Hard Rock Hotel Acoustic Brunch. Slightly complicated to get there. Had to take a boat to Citywalk and then a boat to Hard Rock. Was worth the trip. The food was great and you can get lots of food (specialty pancakes, chicken and waffles, eggs benedicts, omelets) cooked to order so it is not all steam tray eggs and food. The music is VERY loud though. A little distracting loud but the gentleman was a good singer. No other issues other the waiter accidently  giving out table away as we were getting food. But it was handled quickly and was more trouble to the other people then us. 

\-Disney was a late (past midnight) night so Monday was a mostly hotel day. We had dinner at Big Fire Grill at Citywalk. I had a steak with mac and cheese and potatoes. Wife had appetizers dinner of fried green tomatoes and brussel sprouts. She enjoyed both but was not a big fan of the breading for the tomatoes, a personal preference. I really enjoyed my meal, all was good. The potatoes were not really ""smashed"" as they are called but had great flavor and had good crispy bits. 

\-After dinner we went to Blue Man Group. I have not been in about 12 years (in Chicago). The show is pretty much what I remembered but has great music and is really funny. 90 minutes non stop with only a couple of parts which could be considered slow. We had AP tickets (so 30 dollars instead of what looks like 60 dollar regular price tickets). Definite recommend if you can get a ticket deal or special. A little less recommend for full price tickets since it adds up for families but makes for a great date night activity if you can swing it. 

\-Tueday was Volcano Bay. The water coaster is one of the most unappreciated rides at Universal. It is so much fun and thrilling and you will get wet. Early Admission got us 5 rides in a row with pretty much no wait. The rest of the park is really special and sucks you into the theming. Pretty good chicken and curry lunch to.

\-Wednesday was IoA. We rope dropped (kinda) to ride Hagrids. We were through the turnstiles a little after 9. Wait time was 90 minutes. Even with a 10-15 minute delay as they added more cars to the track we were on and off before 10:30. Loved the ride, not sure enough to wait 2.5 hours or so like it went up to but will ride many times next year when things even out. Rest of the day was fast, low wait times. Went over to US to do a few rides in the afternoon.

\-While at IoA we had lunch at Mythos. I have heard people online give Mythos some flack for the ""Worlds best theme park restaurant"" sign they have. Is it the Worlds Best? Probably not. It did exceed expectations by a lot. I had the risotto. Wife had the vegetarian cous cous bowl. Excellent. 

\-Thursday and Friday were HHN nights. On Thursday we did the Unmasking the Horror 3 house Behind the Scenes Tours. Very informative and just so much detail the designers put in for things people will never see in the dark. The tour was a little short for the money (about 2 hours). I think for the price they should make it a 4 house tour. But for HHN fans I would recommend it. 

\-For HHN (both nights) we did 5 houses and the two shows each time. We switched holding areas, staying at the Finnigans area the first night (to get into Ghostbusters fast) and the Simpsons the second night. It would be to long to go through HHN in detail but it was fun, the Original Houses were better then the IP houses this year. Marathon of Mayhem (Lagoon Show) was more style over substance but was just pure enjoyment. Academy of Villains put on a A+++ show. Everyone going to HHN needs to take time to see it. They went above and beyond and really hit there mark this year. 

\-Saturday was IoA again. Much more crowded then the previous day. And the only day where rain was a little problematic. Still wait times were manageable. It may be short and really not that fearful but Doctor Doom Fearfall kinda turned into a guilty pleasure ride after trying it for the first time. Nothing I would wait more then 15 minutes for but kinda cool. Dinner was Mythos. Service was a little slower then lunch previously but food was just as good (had the beef medalions).

\-Saturday night was the premier of the Dark Arts Hogwarts show.  Given that it is only until November and who knows if it will be back next year we waited for the first show. VERY packed with people wanting to watch it. It was good. Not great. 100% say see it if you are there in the evening. The crowds I am sure are already much lower. 

\-Flight home was smooth. There was a Universal Superstar Shuttle leaving when we went to get our Uber from the Hotel. The driver took us to the Airport for free (we had no cash) since he had a lot of room early in the morning. Very nice and shows Universal can easily bring in the ""pixie dust"". 

Extra notes:

\-Saw Tim Tracker one day and said hi. He was very polite. It was cool to see him.

\-One Cabana Bay criticism, There ""Movie at the Pool"" Schedule was a little messed up and some days they had the sign but no movie. In the past it was never a problem so chalk it up to an off week and next year it is all smooth for me.

\-Today Show Caf√© made for a great lunch. Good potato salad. But it was my first Potato salad ever so I do not have much reference.

\-Cabana Bay had a little Universal Resort exclusive Stranger Things photo op. It is all of a 5 minute experience but if you are staying at CBBR check it out. And if you are at any Universal Resort in general CBBR has bowling and some good food so it would be a good afternoon rest day activity.",Mini trip report September 7-15

All that being said, I don't know how Universal Studios handles their tickets. I know you can print them off at the kiosk in the hotel or at the front gate of each park. What I don't know if the kiosk will give away the surprise by detailing out exactly what the ticket gives you access to.

Here are the details of the tickets I bought:

The vacation package came with a stay at RPR, 5 day park hopper, Express pass, Halloween Horror Nights Flex Sunday - Friday Plus 1 Night Free Promotional Ticket. Then I bought the HHN express pass and dining experience separately. 

Thanks in advance for anyone who can answer this extremely specific question.",Ticket question

UniversalOrlando," Hey everyone! I've been to WDW many times, but will be heading to Universal with my partner for the first time next week! It'll be a very short trip, just three nights, two days. I'm a super-planner when it comes to Disney trips with my family, but this will be a very relaxed trip since it's just me and my partner celebrating our birthdays. We plan to spend one day in the parks and another day in CityWalk/hanging out by the pool (staying at Cabana Bay). We're mainly interested in all the Wizarding World attractions and won't be too bothered if we don't get to do everything else. We will not be doing HHN.

A few questions before we go...

1) How heavy can we expect the crowds to be on a Thursday this time of year?

2) Should we bother buying fastpasses ahead of time? I know the queues in the WW are worth seeing, so wondering if we even need fastpasses?

3) How has Hagrid's been in terms of breakdowns and wait time lately?

4)  I've read up on the strict no cell phone and no bag policy for some of the rides, but can I get away with a small fanny pack on any of the bigger WW rides? How about Hagrid's?

5) Any must-dos in either park or CityWalk that you think we shouldn't miss?

I never knew that they had sensors for the goggles, and that they're so on top of that. It makes sense because people were probably stealing them, and they're metal so obviously more expensive than the plastic ones.

So while we went on other rides I used the Universal app to set a notification on when Hagrid‚Äôs opened. At about 11am I received that notification and the wait time was listed as 75min and made another mad dash to the rides entrance. There was about a 5 min line for the lockers. Once we had our stuff secured we went through the queue and rode the ride in about 30 min.  So if you see a long wait time listed don‚Äôt get too discouraged because it seems like the times are being inflated.

This is my Idea for a reworked finale. You begin to go up the lift hill and the damage is apparent. The glass in the small control room to the left Is extremely cracked with a splatter of blood on it. judging by that and the claw marks all over the place, something is inside the building with you. You continue up the lift hill and suddenly a velociraptor pops out of an air duct holding in his jaws a very framiliar severed arm. You continue to ascend when to your left a velociraptor is on the other side of a door looking through the glass. Moist compressed air is blown onto the window to recreate the iconic shot of the velociraptor in jurassic park looking through the door and breathing on it. Once the condinsation clears it spots you and begins slamming on the door. You continue upwards and you hear the sound of the door flying off the hinges implying that the velociraptor had made it through. you finally make it to the top and enter the dilophosaurus scene. They spit at you at usual but if you look carefully you can spot a venom covered rain jacket and a barbisol can. You begin to approuch the drop when suddenly the velociraptors from earlier surround your boat and get into a pouncing position. But before they can pounce, the T-rex emerges and lets out a thunderous roar. the velociraptors scurry off into the shadows and the T-rex tries to eat you but you drop just in time as usual.

She was pretty upset about this, as can be expected, as she loves Harry Potter and that was something that she always had on her and reminded her of our vacation with just the two of us. (We have kids and that's a rarity) 

I searched the internet in hopes I could find one on Ebay or Universal's site. This did not happen. I had all but given up hope but decided I would put out a plea on here in hopes that some kind person could help me out of my predicament. 

A few users asked and stated they would be willing to help and I was hopeful and sent my address to one but nothing came of it. I actually had pretty much forgotten about it (see leaving keys on top of car) until my girlfriend texts me with a picture of an envelope addressed to my Reddit user name and I remembered instantly. 

Thank you u/blueskieslara who refused to be repaid for this. I will most definitely pay it forward.

UniversalOrlando,"This is our family's first trip to Orlando. We are mom, dad, 14 year old twin girls, 11 year old boy. We are staying in at a time share that was gifted to us about 25 minutes from Universal. I'm kind of regretting that we aren't staying on site, as that seems to be the better experience, but free is free.  We are going October 12-19.  
The primary motivation for going to Universal is the Harry Potter stuff. We really don't have much interest in going to Disney, so we're not doing that. Currently the plan is to get four day tickets, drive to the beach one day, and IDK what else. Here's where I need help, I feel very overwhelmed trying to figure all this out. Our only amusement park experience is smaller, local places so I feel kind of lost.

  
1. One of my daughters has major sensory issues and is on the autism spectrum. Should we look into getting accommodations? I tried to pick a slow week based on the crowd forecast calendar. What exactly do the accommodations get you? She is ok with waiting, but it's really the crowd of waiting in line that gets to her - other kids being loud, the general din of people talking, etc. We plan on breaking up our days, spending a few hours at the park, then go back to our resort, come back later in the evening.  
2. How necessary is it to get the 3 park ticket for every day? I know you need at least the 2-park for Harry Potter World. How big is Volcano Bay? Will we likely go to that while we are visiting the other parks? Or should we just do it one day?  
3. How do you go about schlepping all your stuff? If we're doing the waterpark stuff along with the regular park, is there a centrally located locker area? At smaller parks I either just get it from the car or put it in a locker. Should I get one of those carts? I hate carrying a big bag of towels and crap.  
4. Are the meal plans worth it?  
5. I see we are going to be there during the HHN. Is a ticket for one night good, or do you really need more than one night to appreciate it ?

Anything else I should know? Thanks for your help!","Visiting for the first time, family of 5, staying off site. Need advice!"

UniversalOrlando,"I'm visiting a friend and we're going to Universal this weekend (Sat-Mon)! I've never been and I'm so excited. I unfortunately had to buy base tickets because my friend (FL resident) was able to get a deal on base tickets and didn't want to spend more. 

She actually hasn't spent a ton of time at the parks, and I've done so much research lol. So I'm not positive she knows that we can't do the Hogwarts Express. It's something I really really wanted to do, but she's already driving me to the parks and hosting me so I didn't want to push her to spend even more right up front. I figured I could live with a base ticket. 

I was just wondering though if there's a way to upgrade from base ticket to park to park? Because if so, and if she brings up the train, then absolutely I'll ask her. I doubt you can do it but I figured I'd check here! 

Also, I'm hoping to convince her to add on HHN because it sounds so cool! So it'll probably be either/or, I just want to know our options :) thanks!","If I have the base ticket (1 park per day) can I pay to ""upgrade"" to the park to park ticket? Or am I just stuck with what I purchased?"

It seems like if you bundle it in with an Express Pass you can save $10 overall, but we‚Äôre thinking of not bothering with the Express Pass - we only want to go on 9 rides across the two parks which should be doable in 12 hours. $580 seems like a _lot_ for one day in a couple of theme parks :(",Any benefit to buying a ticket in advance?

UniversalOrlando,"I know this is a dead horse but I really just wanted to provide my thoughts on Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure!

Wow. Just wow! I have now ridden the ride twice, once during the day, and once during some light rain in the afternoon and what an amazing attraction. I am not someone who likes rollercoasters -- I've tried doing Dragon Challenge and Rockit, but it really just isn't my vibe at all! I can stomach rides like Mummy and Gringotts so I was really banking on Hagrid's and I loved it. Just the perfect amount of thrill -- the launches are so exhilarating and truly inspire the want to throw your hands up!

Theming is phenomenal -- Universal has truly put their all into theming the ride. While of course there is the occasional view of outside lands, and the eyesore that is Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit, for the majority of the ride it really feels like your blasting through the Forbidden Forest and exploring unforeseen ruins of Hogwarts Castle. The animatronics are detailed and the two times I've gone past the Hagrid animatronic I wave at it... you just have to! I've been able to ride both sidecar and motorbike, and while both were enjoyable experiences, the motorbike is where it's at! Truly feels like your just on a flying motorbike and is everything I could've asked for. The time I rode it in the rain was so much fun. Just added a whole other level of immersion and made it feel vastly different from my first ride. 

Also, something I have noticed with these super inflated wait times is not to be wary of them! Unless there is some random delay from weather or something, you won't wait nearly as long as the posted time is. The first time I rode it the wait time was 180 minutes and we got on the ride in a little more than an hour! Something I will say to folks like me who don't like rollercoasters (particularly for me who thoroughly dislikes the sensation of dropping), just give it a try. I have made an effort to sit as far back in the train as possible as I do not want to go all the way up the 60 foot spike about halfway through the ride, and I highly recommend anyone scared of heights or dropping to do the same. The drop track portion seems very daunting at first but it was surprisingly tame -- while yes you get that dropping sensation, it is super quick and very calm, not at all jarring. Other than the drop track, there are no other parts of the ride that worried me whatsoever, and as long as you can handle speed this ride will be nothing but fun. 

As a huge Harry Potter and theme park fan, I would probably rank this ride above my favorite ride at Universal, Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey. I am a Forbidden Journey lover through and through and yet Hagrid's is so much fun and joy. Both times I've ridden it I've come off with a smile and feeling of glee that lasts for quite a while! I would rank the WWOHP rides as follows:

1. Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure
2. Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey
3. Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts
4. Hogwarts Express
5. Flight of the Hippogriff

If you've read this much thank you!!! I truly recommend this ride to everyone and it is just such a good time! Bye!",Thoughts on Hagrid's

We're hoping to go to Volcano Bay on Saturday, and then hit up both Universal Studios &amp; Islands of Adventure on Saturday.

Part of me is wondering if the park could be quieter due to Dorian and Galaxy's Edge, but also another part of me is wondering if some rides could be shut down, and then we could quite easily get one everything we want at each park even without the fast pass (there's around 4 things in Studios, and 5 in Islands)

I typically avoid destination spots on holiday weekends but I was able to book a room at the Endless Summer resort for Saturday and Sunday night.

I was wondering based on experience, how is fun VB for non-swimmers?  Is there enough rides and things to do that don't requiring swimming?",Volcano Bay for non-swimmers?
UniversalOrlando,"We just returned from our trip and I thought I'd share some thoughts...mostly because I'm back at work and really don't want to be here!

The weather this week could not have been better.  Temps stayed in the upper 80's to low 90's.  Humidity was reasonable and we had enough cloud cover that the sun was never really beating down on us.  Unlike our Disney trip last year at this time, we had no thunder storms and just 1 day with a shower.

We stayed at the Portofino resort.  The hotel itself was beautiful and I think the room may have been a bit larger than our room at the Grand Floridian.  Our room was located between two of the pools.  One was your standard pool that seemed to be favored by people without kids.  The other had a zero entry with a sandy beach, water slide, activities, etc.  Since we had an 8 and 10yr old with us, this is where we spent most of our time.  This pool offered a bunch of activities for the kids such as cornhole, nightly movies, music, pool table, etc.  Waiters were always close by to take drink and food orders.  On Saturday night, they strung up colored lights, threw a bunch of light up inflatable balls into the pool and turned the kiddie spray area into a foam party.  Getting the kids ready for club life early.  We mostly took the boat back and forth to the park, but also decided to walk a couple of times.  With kids, I'd say it was roughly 15 mins.  They also offer those rickshaw bikes which operate on gratuity and probably knock down the commute to about 5 mins.

I had not been to Universal or IoA in about 15yrs, so the parks were much different.  My kids absolutely loved Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade.  Our hotel came with the unlimited Express Pass.  If you can swing it, I'd say go for it.  This was worth it's weight in gold.  We rode some rides 8x, something we could not do at Disney.

Family favorites - Escape from Gringotts, Forbidden Journey, Hagrid, Bilge Rat Barge (you WILL get soaked), Hulk, Jimmy Fallon (my kids loved this and don't even know who he is), Dudley Do-Right (another soaker), Jurassic river boat ride.

Meh - Flight of the Hippogriff.  This was over in like 1 min.  My daughter enjoyed it, so we went 2x, but really it was just over too quick and didn't live up to the others.  Minions.  Kids hated that one.  Dr. Seuss.  They are just too old for this, but we were walking through and decided to ride the train.  I like train type rides, so it was fine.  Young ones seemed to enoy this.

I thought the kids would complain about the ET ride since it's old and not very thrilling, but they had fun.

By the way, we rode Hagrid 3x.  I had been reading the nightmare stories of long lines, breakdowns, etc, so I told the kids we would probably not ride it at all.  The wait time was listed at 120 mins and my son pushed for it.  I'm glad we did.  From start to finish it took us 45 mins.  Next day the wait time said 150 mins and we were in and out in roughly 1hr.  Last day it was all over the map.  Said 120, then 150, then 180, then dropped to 90.  We jumped in line and were out in 35 mins.  The ride is awesome.  Don't let the wait times scare you away.  They have great themes inside and the line moved quick.  I'm glad we did this.

For food, it was a mixed bag.  I have celiac disease, so I need to seek out safe places to eat.  I did my research before and had luck at Margaritaville, Mythos, Confiscos Grill, and NBC Grill.  The pool bar at our hotel had gf buns for burgers, but the waiter said they toast regular buns on the same grill as the burgers, so cross contamination was high.  We had some instacart groceries delivered from Publix, so on the days we ended at the pool, I made a meal from hummus and gf crackers and many rum punches.  For my fellow celiacs, Confiscos, NBC, and Margaritaville have a dedicated fryer for fries / tots.  Confiscos also has gf wings.  I hear the turkey legs are gf and some of the bbq options near Jurassic are safe as well.  I wanted to hit Bob Marley and Antojitos, but they are not open for lunch and it just didn't work out.  Menchies frozen yogurt is gf.  Waitstaff at these places seemed very knowledgeable and asked the chef when they were not sure of something.  At NBC, the chef delivered my food separate and explained how he changed gloves and used a separate prep area.  Always nice to get this kind of assurance.  Most of those places also offer some gf desserts, but I did not have them.

Kinda rambling since I'm running on no sleep after flight delays, but I'd be happy to elaborate on anything if someone has questions.  Can't wait to go back!",Trip Report - week of 8/18

Something I thought I'd say as I don't think enough people do this. It's always worth remembering the names of the staff members who have been exceptional throughout your visit because it gets passed on to their managers and I believe it leads to perks for them. The staff here are the best I've ever seen anywhere. They genuinely enjoy their jobs, are enthusiastic, and really want the best for the customers. Universal creates an accepting and welcoming environment for all and I think it's brilliant, and deserves to be recognised.

Some tips for giving positive feedback:
- keep a list of the names in a small notebook or a sheet of paper you can carry around with you so you don't forget
- remember (write down) the date, time and location. Because only the first name is shown on the badges, guest services need to know details about when/where the staff member was on shift to ensure they have the correct person
- remember (write down) how that staff member has helped you / made your day better, as this information goes on the database",Give guest services the names of the staff who have been exceptional!

UniversalOrlando,"Hello! My husband and I are getting ready for our trip to Universal next month. (31 days!!). 
We will be at the park September 18-22. We leave September 22 on a cruise out of Port Canaveral, so that is not a day we can do the park. My husband purchased tickets during the Buy 2 days, get 3 free promo. We have the 3 park, park-to-park tickets. We also purchased the buy one night get one free tickets for HHN. I know you don‚Äôt have to plan much for Universal like you do Disney, but I wanted to have a loose plan in my head, and have some questions. 

1. The main reason we are going is for Harry Potter, but we love rides and want to do everything at all the parks. We land around 12 on Wednesday, so I definitely want to get in the parks that day. I‚Äôm not sure where we should start. Would it matter to do one park first over the other? In my head I would like to do Diagon Alley first for a true experience of going from there to Hogsmeade. 

2. I plan on doing HHN Thursday &amp; Friday, because I am concerned we will be too tired Wednesday from traveling. I am a little concerned about getting to the parks early in the morning, being there all day, and then spending the night there until 1 am. We are relatively young (30 &amp; 34) and in good health, but I am worried that‚Äôs too much. Should we take a break mid day? We are staying at Cabana Bay. It seems like the park will be slower then, so maybe early admission isn‚Äôt as important and we could sleep in? 

3. Water rides. We love them but I‚Äôm nervous about how we are going to dry off. Will we be miserable if our shoes and socks get drenched? At amusement parks here in Ohio I typically just wear flip flops, but I know that I need to wear tennis shoes to Universal with all the walking. Should I bring sandals in our backpack to change into for the water rides?

4. Volcano Bay-is 1 day enough for VB?

5. Tickets-everything I have read says to avoid the ticket booths at the park. Our email reservation does not have the tickets on there, so do I have to go to that booth? The email made it sound like maybe the hotel has a place I can print our tickets? 

6. Restaurants recommendations! Tell me your favorite places to eat. We are foodies and love trying new things. I know I want to go to Mythos, and definitely want to do the HP restaurants as well. What else do you recommend in the park or around the area?

Thanks in advance for any advice. This group has been so helpful as we have been planning this trip!!",September Trip &amp; HHN

UniversalOrlando,"Thanks to all of your wonderful advice, I've decided to do 3 days at Universal with my friend. I've never been before and had a few questions because I've seen conflicting info online and even in this sub!!!

My two biggest questions are:

1) Bag Policy: I'm confused and just want to have the most updated info on this possible. I was planning on bringing a small backpack (Jansport Half Pint). I was going to put my wallet, keys, sunscreen, water bottle, etc, in it. I was planning on this because the Universal website said backpacks were fine. Then I did some more reading. And I saw that a lot of rides don't allow it and lockers are chaos. At least I had read that the lockers were free. Then I saw an article from 2018 that said that Universal CHARGES for a locker at the ride if you have a backpack. So I'm slightly confused. 


I'm the kind of person who totes around everything but the kitchen sink. I really want to be able to bring my bag with me. If its like Six Flags, and I have to ditch my bag in a locker pre-ride, it's NBD. But if the locker costs money? Heck no. I'm a broke college student. üòÇ so my question basically is, do lockers at rides cost money/are they hard to get and chaotic? 


2) HHN: I'm going to be in the parks Sept 7-8-9. I just found out that this is when HHN starts! One person told me that everything except HP will be closed once they start. Universal's website had little to no helpful info. I'm just confused. I don't want to pay more for HHN, so does this mean I'll need to leave the parks earlier in the day? Just wanting some clarification!!!

UniversalOrlando,"My girlfriend and I have been thinking about taking a trip to Universal Orlando in late December to early January. She‚Äôs just now reading the Harry Potter books and for the time being we‚Äôre immersed in the fandom.  It‚Äôs been a lot of fun rereading the series and seeing her experience the books and movies for the first time. 

We thought that New Years Eve might be a fun experience to have while at Universal Orlando but I can‚Äôt seem to find any park events that are specifically related to New Years Eve. I can imagine that there are some pretty great events or I can also see how the parks would be closed during NYE and we may have to find something to do in the hotel (were thinking about staying in the surf side inn although I think that Sapphire Bay might be a more romantic albeit more expensive setting.)

UniversalOrlando,"So rolling off some of the rumored areas &amp; attractions to be featured in Universal Orlando's 4th gate, Epic Universe, I wanted to share my thoughts on said rumors, theories on the overall concept of the park, &amp; speculation what IPs and types of attractions will be featured there.

For starters, I think all the rumored lands are spot on, except I'm still having a hard time seeing a entire area that, based on the concept art, will feature at least 3 full scale attractions. I know it is a very popular series, but as a singular franchise, i don't think it has the cultural impact, or even the content, to fill such a space. I know I'm not alone in these thoughts, as many have speculated that it will be more of a mash-up of DreamWorks properties (with some theories I on those that I will get to later), but maybe I really am just underselling the popularity &amp; appeal of the HTTYD series. 

Most people seem to theorize that the central ""HUB"" will be a City Walk style shopping &amp; entertainment center, but I'm pretty doubtful of that. While I'm sure it will contain plenty of shops, eateries, etc. that are not associated with specific themes, I still think it's a part of the gated park. Early rumors were that each of the ""Worlds"" would be their own gated / ticketed entities, but based on the amount of space they encompass &amp; visible attractions, this seems unlikely. &amp; while they could be a single ticket park just split up into different areas / gates, certain aspects of the HUB area suggest that there will be a number of attractions that are attached to this area - most obvious being the dueling launch coaster. If you look at the concept art, there are at least 3 other buildings that appear to be the size / structure of a typical show building that houses a ride / attraction; the one by the entrance, the one right next to the rumored ""Classic Monsters"" area, and the space station looking building near the launch coaster. These buildings don't appear to have windows, which is generally a tell-tale sign, &amp; the large size of them don't really make sense for being stand alone restaurants. And then of course there's what looks to be a carousel directly across from the show building entrance.  

\*\* Now, there's an argument to be made that since the hotel looks to feed directly into the HUB area that this area can't be a part of a gated park, but I'd wager there's a gated entrance way we're just not seeing. 

But moving onto the themes &amp; speculated attractions:

Super Nintendo World - seems like a lock and each of the 3 rumored rides: Mario Kart, Yoshi's Adventure and DK Mine Cart Madness can more or less be identified since this concept art matches the leaked model of the land when it was supposed to replace Kid's Zone &amp; Universal Studios Florida. 

Classic Monster Movie World - the spooky aesthetic of this area seems to line up with the theme well. The rumored Dracula's Castle attraction that will utilize a similar ride system to Harry Potter &amp; the Forbidden Journey looks to be squarely in the back of this area of the park where the obvious castle structure is. I think this ride could be VERY cool considering the ride design lends perfectly for having animatronics pop out directly at riders &amp; the floating feeling it creates gives a sense of helplessness &amp; overall thrill. Another rumored attraction is a HHN style walkthrough / maze &amp; I could see that going in the mansion-esque building right of the entrance gate; however, I'd be willing to bet that any permanent walkthrough attraction will probably be more theatrical in nature &amp; might end up being more like a mix of an HHN maze and a special effects walkthrough like Poseidon's Furry. I also think that they could &amp; should really make the most of this area by placing scare actors &amp; classic movie set pieces throughout the streets. Since this area, like the other themed areas, is completely enclosed from the rest of the park, having it be too scary for children really isn't an issue since parents can choose to not bring their kids to this area of the park as they are not forced to travel through to get to another section. 

The Wizarding World of Fantastic Beasts -  I was skeptical on this at first since I don't think Fantastic Beasts on its own has been a very strong franchise, but others have pointed out that the area syncs up with Paris's Wizarding District in the 2nd movie; and also, anything Wizarding World is going to sell, even if the specific movies the attractions are based on might not be quite as impactful as the Harry Potter series. The most interesting thing about this area is that 2/3rds of it appears to be indoors in sort of 1 massive show building. Guests being able to explore the Paris (and Hell, possibly even the London via ""flu powder"") Ministry of Magic on foot would be very cool, with the rides / attractions being housed within this same large-scale, single building. An attraction where guests ride through the various floors of the Ministry makes sense (there was even a recent Universal patent that seems to lend itself well to the concept), but I still would have preferred a drop tower / dark ride hybrid like  Disney's Tower of Terror - judging by the shape &amp; size of the building though, it doesn't look to be any more than 4-5 stories so that wouldn't work. An attraction where guests venture into the magical beasts sanctuary within Newt's suitcase is also rumored, and i could see this being a walkthrough attraction with the beasts being brought to life through animatronics / special effects - though I suppose a slow-moving dark ride would work just as well. 

The World of DreamWorks / How To Train Your Dragon - as I discussed earlier, this area being solely HHTYD is a bit of a stretch for me, so my speculation is based on it being a greater DreamWorks World as a whole. First attraction to note is the roller coaster that runs through this area and into show buildings - this seems like a lock for a HTTYD coaster if this land does end up matching up with the DreamWorks theme. I also wouldn't be surprised if the whole section of this area north of the bridge matches up with the theming of this specific franchise. Moving south though, there is a theater style show-building that seems like it would be perfect to house the DreamWorks theater attraction that is already  at Hollywood and is currently focus's on the Kung Fu Panda franchise. There's what appears to be a water based attraction just west of it that, judging on its size, would be either battle boats or some children's water ride. I'm not too sure on what franchise this would match up to but maybe Madagascar? Lastly, there's another fairly large show building to the southwest of this area - probably some sort of dark ride or mo sim hybrid like The Spectacular Adventures of Spider-Man. As for the theme, it could really be anything: Shrek, Trolls, etc. - there does appear to be some gold sigil on the top of the building facing the entrance but since the picture is from the back, its impossible to tell what it is or what it even could be. 

Now for the attractions that appear attached to the HUB:

The show-building next to the entrance looks to be medieval or ancient themed, &amp; given its proximity to the Super Nintendo World, I could definitely see it being a Legend of Zelda attraction. While ti would be weird for it to not be part of the enclosed Super Nintendo World, i could see it being the case for 2 reasons: 1) it has a different aesthetic that the cartoonish Mario / Donkey Kong, 2) since it was not part of the originally planned Kid's Zone replacement, they chose not to alter the design &amp; instead build the expansion as a separate entity. I know a lot of people expect there to be an entire area based of the franchise, possibly as a replacement for The Lost Continent at IOA, but while Zelda is a popular franchise, especially amongst gamers, i don't think it has *quite* the same amount of familiarity to casual park goers as the other 2, so an entire land might not exactly be warranted. Anyways, if it is a Zelda attraction, I'd like to see it be an interactive trackless dark ride with diverging paths through the Dungeons of Hyrule, with there being interactive sections in which riders can solve a puzzle to unlock a different route &amp; collect key items that alter the narrative &amp; ride experience. 

The show-building next to the Monster Movie area is speculated to the themed to Pok√©mon as the design seems to match up to that of a Pok√©mon gym &amp; the statues / theming appear to match certain Pok√©mon. But IMO it really just doesn't make sense to put this attraction DIRECTLY next to the Monsters section and decently removed from the main Super Nintendo area. Instead, I'm thinking it might be more of a jungle themed attraction given the aesthetic - maybe something like Tomb Raider, or Hell even Jumanji. I think either one would make for a cool dark ride attraction. 

The show-building in the northeast shaped like a space station is speculated to be Star Trek given the space-like theme and how its shaped kind of like the Enterprise. I think a motion simulator attraction would make sense here &amp; seems like it would line up with the size of the show building. Additionally, while the duel launch coasters might not be  specifically Star Trek themed (you figure if they'd do that, they'd just build an entire enclosed area for these attractions to share), it does seem to have some limited outer space theming so its proximity to the Star Trek ride adds up. 

There's also 2 more buildings that look like they c*ould* be show buildings, on to the northeast of the Super Nintendo World entrance, and one with its back to the DreamWorks section. Not really sure what properties they would put in either since there is absolutely no tell to the theming, though judging on the overall parks description, I'd be willing to bet they'd still be themed to some existing IP. 

If my theories on the park are correct, we may be getting anywhere from 15 - 20 attractions; this seems like a lot for a brand new park (I think IOA opened with 14 or so) but given the scale and Universal's desire to make the best theme park in the world, going big makes a lot of sense. Also to note that people hoping this park includes a lot of thrill rides and less mo sim / screens are going to be a bit disappointed - while it seems like we're getting at least 3 coasters, most of the other attractions appear to take place within show buildings and thus are more likely to be the sort of dark ride / mo sim hybrids that Universal has become known for. 

Anyways, want to know what you all think. Anyone disagree &amp; think the attractions are going to be confined to the separate ""Worlds"" and the buildings that I'm identifying in the HUB are just shopping centers, etc.?  Anybody got some ideas on what sort of IPs &amp; attractions might work here? Please share!",Epic Universe - Theories &amp; Speculation

UniversalOrlando,"I was just at Islands of Adventure a week ago and I had a great time, but there are some issues with HPATFJ that have not always existed, and I think it needs to be looked at by the powers that exist there.

The audio and video do not match up on several parts in the ride, as well as certain cues such as the dementors getting right in your face (that movement is slightly delayed, so the dementor is retreating by the time you get close to it, rather than following the car like it once did), and the audio in general is just too quiet. I constantly heard the banging and whirring of the machinery of the ride over the audio playing from the seats, and all of these problems seriously take a toll on the illusion that the ride is supposed to create.

Things like this should be first priority for a VR ride, and I hope someone on their management team actually rides the ride ASAP to understand the problem.

Was this an issue for anyone else when they went? Maybe I just caught a bad day for the ride, but these things seem like problems resulting from this ride being around for a while and naturally having some parts degrade if left unchecked.",Harry Potter and The Forbidden Journey in need of maintenance

UniversalOrlando,,"TIL Disney had a chance to buy Universal Studios back in 2002, due to the latter's parent company--Vivendi--struggling with a large amount of debt after acquiring Universal from Seagram in 2001"
UniversalOrlando,"So we all know by now about Epic Universe and we may know about the rumored lands. Just figured I‚Äôd suggest some properties that Universal would most likely have access to that could fit in among the Fantastic Beasts, DreamWorks Dragons, Mario, and Universal Monsters lands that will ***supposedly*** make up this new park.

First of all, let‚Äôs talk Warner Bros. They seem to have a pretty nice relationship with Universal, as in the past Uni has been able to use properties like Beetlejuice and Nightmare on Elm Street, while currently they‚Äôre the ones licensing out the behemoth that is Harry Potter. If Fantastic Beasts truly is part of this new park, why not go further to appeal to more audiences? Warner Bros. makes its presence known in other parts of the world through small, sometimes indoor, parks, primarily utilizing DC Comics, Cartoon Network, Looney Tunes, Tom and Jerry, and Hanna-Barbera for inspiration. I don‚Äôt know if HB would be profitable nowadays outside of Scooby-Doo or The Flintstones/Jetsons (plus it was already canned a while back in the main park), but Cartoon Network could create a serious pull. With ‚Äò90s nostalgia that isn‚Äôt just the Nicktoons emerging, it‚Äôs a good time to cash in on Dexter‚Äôs Lab, The Powerpuff Girls, etc. while also utilizing the extremely popular recent franchises like Adventure Time, Steven Universe, and Gumball. 

Looney Tunes and Tom and Jerry could also do pretty well, as its characters are basically American icons, plus their appearances in other parks have been generally well-received. As for DC, that might be a hard sell next to Marvel. However, that could mean a serious distraction from Islands of Adventure, long enough to ditch Marvel in favor of a property that isn‚Äôt looking outdated, while Disney gets to build their fourth Marvel land. The mouse gets something they‚Äôve craved for years, while Universal gets more opportunities to wow people.

Let‚Äôs also not forget that Warner Bros. owns HBO. If Jurassic Park is any indication, sometimes a malfunctioning deadly theme park can be a fun ride idea. Westworld? If that seems pretty out there, how about Westeros, the widely popular setting from Game of Thrones?

To finish up the WB train, other epic worlds that could work while still being popular and relevant: Beetlejuice, Lord of the Rings, The Matrix, Cyberpunk 2077 (maybe but promising), Mortal Kombat, Mad Max, Rick and Morty, The Wizard of Oz (and/or Wicked, which is being produced by Universal for 2021.)

Nickelodeon is also worth mentioning, considering SpongeBob still has [a viral presence at the parks](https://youtu.be/a7PqyopzNPo). If a Cartoon Network area wouldn‚Äôt pan out, I could easily see this happening in its place. However, Viacom and CBS have literally just announced a merger earlier today. This might complicate things with a CBS property, The Twilight Zone, in a Disney park, or it might make things VERY GOOD for Universal if Disney is planning to change up the Tower of Terror. I hope they don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs like my favorite thing they‚Äôve done, but I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs staying much longer. If Uni and Viacom can establish a stronger partnership in the theme park industry, that means an INSANE film and television library could be opened up.

Before I finally get to Universal‚Äôs actual properties, I just also want to mention that Hawkins from Stranger Things would also be a fun one to have? ‚Äò80s nostalgia is going out the door for sure but everyone loves a good mindflayer. Sure it‚Äôs already HHN and Netflix might be losing ground next to other streaming services in the future, including attempts by Universal AND Warner, but everybody and their mother watches this show. Its impact is truly incredible, and it‚Äôs sustained a great level of quality over time.

Finally, onto Universal‚Äôs own properties. Surprisingly, they don‚Äôt have all that much to go off of. If they had a big franchise, it‚Äôs been used before, it‚Äôs already rumored for something else, or it might just be too obscure at this point. Shrek would be a fun one if they went ahead and replaced Shrek 4-D, although the character alone being at the front of their main park is a huge sell. A lot of people love Shrek, and a lot of visitors love seeing him as soon as they walk in, even if the show is aging a little bit. Personally, though, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd double dip on DreamWorks. If Dragons is actually happening, that should be it for the studio. However, I could see them maybe doing something with Trolls, probably something that appeals to very small children.

Aside from that though, there isn‚Äôt much left. Nintendo is a partner they made recently, so in the future they might try and branch out. Maybe some anime? For right now, there doesn‚Äôt seem to be another move they would predictably make besides wholly original content.

And that‚Äôs about it for my predictions! I only made this primarily because it looks like there are parts of the park not being shown or elaborated on at all, plus areas that could be cleared out for very obvious expansion room. Let me know your thoughts. Do you agree? Disagree? Anything? I‚Äôd love to hear other opinions on this because this definitely interests me after looking through all the possibilities.",Epic Universe - Which Franchises?

There are two parts of this art that I am interested in the most. The glass dome in the middle of the middle lake has the potential to be really cool. Not sure what kind of attraction would fit in there though. Maybe a restaurant over the water? I would definitely eat there.

Secondly, what is being called the classic monsters land for now(top left) seems to have a huge theatre. A universal monsters show would be super cool. A lot of potential there.

UniversalOrlando,"Unofficial Universal tweeted that the new Universal Park (leaning towards Epic Worlds at the moment) will only be comprised of 3 lands and a Castle centerpiece.  

That seems low for a new park. It seems that most people were expecting 4/5 lands. Nintendo Land, Harry Potter Land, Universal Monsters Land, Dreamworks Land, and one Surprise Land. 

What if we are thinking TO specific on the lands. What if those specific ideas are not the lands themselves but just what we will find in the lands?

What if we had THESE for the lands (yes the names are bad but Universal could do better)

1. Epic Play- This would be the most focused land, and pretty much be Super Nintendo Land. This would be the biggest draw and where the Castle centerpiece would be. Epic Play could encompass both Nintendo AND Pokemon (technically a separate company) and leave room for expansion to other Videogame IP without going against the name (not Sony or Microsoft but maybe retro old school like Pac-Man).
2. Epic Adventure-This would house both Harry Potter and Universal Monsters. They would be connected but not intermixed. It could be as simple as connected by bridges like IoA or hidden from each other like Diagon Alley is from US. They could also put rides here that might not require a whole land or area dedicated to them. People want to see the return of Jaws. That would fall under Adventure for me. Those rides could also serve as a mini hub to get to the bigger more themed sections.
3. Epic Dreams- The Dreamworks/Illuminations area. The most kid friendly of the lands it would require the least all around theming since they would be pulling from Minions, Sing, Pets, How to Train your Dragon, and others. The theme itself could be dreaming and the wonder of imagination so it would be more whimsical and not as nailed down theming, although the individual rides would still be highly themed to there IPs.",[Rumor] New park will only be comprised of 3 lands.

UniversalOrlando,"We went on our first trip to Universal last January and had an amazing time. So much so, that we are thinking of taking advantage of the B2G3 Ticket deal for our son's birthday this September. Before we pull the trigger though, we had a few questions about USO that time of year. 

First question: Weather. We had perfect weather when we were there in January, not too hot or too cold, it stayed in the 70s and 80s the whole time. I'm sure there is a big difference between Sept and Jan in Orlando, but how hot is it usually  that time of year and are storms a big problem? I know predicting weather is pretty much a crap shoot, but any advice on what we could expect would be appreciated.

Second Question: HHN. It looks like it will be going on pretty much the whole time we will be there, meaning US will close at 5:00 and IOA closes early too (7:00 I think). One of our favorite things about Universal is being in the park at night when the lights are on and everything is all lit up, but it seems we would have to leave when it's still light out. I'm looking into getting the multiple night passes for HHN (which sounds amazing to me), but my wife hates haunted houses and people jumping out at her/chasing her with chainsaws and stuff like that. We will also be with our 11 year old son (he will have just turned 12 at that time) and aren't sure if it will be too scary or inappropriate for him. I know they say they don't recommend children under 13, but are there usually younger children there or is it all teenagers and adults? Are there any ""scare-free"" areas in US while HHN is going on for those who just want to enjoy the later park hours but not be scared or startled by the actors? 

Anyway, hanks in advance for any advice and looking forward to hearing what you guys have to say. =)

UniversalOrlando,"(Sorry this is so long, half of the reason I am typing this is to get my game plan down from out of my head, onto ""paper""

  
***TLDR: I'm going to Universal and have a few questions at the end of the post! :)*** 

I hope this an okay place to ask this. I have a work trip next week (August 8th-17th).

I ended up taking advantage of this amazing deal Universal has going on right now. I have a Stay Over Weekend for work! (Which means I get to get paid 8 hours a day, and sit in a hotel) Instead of sitting in the hotel, I figured I'd go to the parks! Win/Win right? I have a 3rd full day off as well in the middle of the week.

I've been doing WAY to much research but there are a few questions I wasn't 100% sure of and wanted to get some clarification if that would be okay, and I figured I'd use this thread to come back to during this week of prep/while I was on site if I thought of other questions. It seams like a really inviting/active/friendly community so thank you!

Before I get to my questions I thought I'd lay out my thoughts of the week and see if you guys think this is doable/a good plan of action, or if you have other recommendations.

The last time I was at US/IOA I was on my honeymoon in July of 2013 with my wife. We had an absolute blast. At that point and time Diagon Alley wasn't completed yet so we only go to experience Hogsmeade. I am going back for a work trip as I said early, and I am going to the parks SOLO. I will be all by myself (Single Rider Lines!?!) and my main focus will be the two Harry Potter ""Parks within Parks""

My goal with Day one was to start off on the Universal Studios side of things and experience everything that side of the park has to offer. I plan on even though I am a single rider I am going to do everything the first time with the normal queue I do not want to miss any of the extra's they throw into the normal queue. I also am going to go into every shop, I want to get a wand from Ollivander (and waiting in line for him to personally sell it to me) Do all of the Magic Wand spots (even the hidden ones!) Eat a crap ton of food! (I get $75 a day for food to expense for work!) Drink way to many Frozen Butterbeers lol and just search every nook and cranny.

So here's where I start to not be 100% sure of what I should/can do. Can I actually spend a full day in Diagon Alley only? Can I do both HP Sides in One Day? Should I expand out my Harry Potterness to not get overload, and maybe just stay in US and not do Hogsmeade until Day 2? I feel like the best option would be Day 1 try to do all of Harry Potter. I can't see myself not being able to complete everything in 1 day. I am by myself, no naps, cranky kids, I can stay from Park Open to Park Close, I can eat in the Park. I have all the time I need (albeit their opening hours) The only issue is Hagrids new ride. I was planning on playing that one by ear, if I can do it the first day great, if not, head straight there day two when they first open and HOPE it's there when the gates open, if not wait around that general area until it does open.

So if I finish everything (maybe minus Hagrid's Ride) Day 1, I figured day 2 I would do my favorite parts of Harry Potters sections again, perhaps save the 2nd Hogwarts Express Ride for Day 2 for something else new? And do IOA/US rides the 2nd day.

Day three would be more of the same of day 2. Crossing off anything else I missed on day 2 from the main park areas. I hope to be able to go on everything! I am even considering vlogging/documenting my experience for fun I haven't decided yet. I also want to play a lot of ""Harry Potter Go"" (Wizards Unite) while I am at the park. So many things I want to do! Not enough time! (but I think I do have time, prob. way to much time lol)

  
Days 4 and 5 are going to be much much shorter as they are work days. I am staying at a Double Tree right at the entrance to Universal Studios. So when I am done with work, I can go back to my hotel, and hit the park for a few hours at night, during the week, and pretty late, so hopefully I can hit a few of my favorites a handful of times at night!

So that's kinda my ideas S.P.E.W.d out into text. Sorry to long, and rambled.

Here are my questions (and if you did read all of that, please provide feedback as to my goals/thoughts if you have them!)

1. Is 1 Day for both Harry Potter parks doable/Should I break it into 2?
2. Other than Harry Potter Worlds are there any Single Rideable Eligible Lines that you recommend NOT using the first time to get the full experience?
3. When I went to Hogwarts ride back in 2013 I remember there was a locker room attached to the Gift Shop, at about 70% of the line. To me it looked like there was nothing stopping someone from walking into the Gift Shop, and skipping the lockers, and just walking back into the line? Is this intended? Is this still a thing?
4. Is there a list of all Hidden Magic Wand Spots?
5. At night, there is the Light show on Hogwarts Castle, is that every night? I keep checking Universal's website, but it doesn't have dated listed for the days I am going to be there, Do they stop that?
6. Warm Butterbeer isn't served in August is it?
7. Is Jurassic Park Water ride still there? I heard they were building some kind of new coaster/raptor ride, but I remember really really liking that water ride. 
8. If/When I buy an Interactive Wand will I be able to carry this onto rides, or will I need a locker every time for this one item? I plan on walking around light, and getting my purchesables when I am leaving the park. I don't want to have to spend a ton of time in lockers.
9. Not really a question, but more of a suggestion for #9, if money wasn't a concern (I get $75 a day for food from work) What are the MUST trys for food at Harry Potter World(s) or any place in the park.
10. Just want to thank you all for reading this and replying, I am sure I will have other questions. If you guys are interested I will post replies to this once I am in the park, at if I do vlog, post my adventure here too.

I am soo freaking excited. Some people think it's odd to go to a park alone, but I'm oddly excited about it. I will miss my wife, and 3 year old, but I think he's still too little to enjoy places like WDW/US/IOA ect but I can't wait to take him there as well someday ""soon"" (thinking around 6 or 7)",Just Got the Buy 2 Days Get 3 Free Pass: Questions

UniversalOrlando,"We all know that Park 4 (Fantastic Worlds) will be the main focus. But Universal is more then just a stand alone park so what can we expect OTHER then the park itself? I am thinking, purely speculating...

-2 hotels, possibly 3. 1 (or 2) will be Deluxe hotels which will have Express pass included to the park. Whether the Express will carry over to the original 2 parks I do not know but I can not see them splitting the fanbase. 

The other hotel will be a more Moderate Cabana Bay style hotel. Early Entry but no Express Pass.  It would still be fully featured though (like how Cabana Bay has 2 pools and a Lazy River). 

All the new hotels will be walking/boat/monorail(?) Distance to the new park. Bus service to the original parks and Volcano Bay.

People wanting Value hotels have Endless Summer which is more in the middle of the new Resort area. 

-Road expansion between parks. Working with Orlando Universal will expand the main roads between the new park and the original resort. Rumors have floated of bus only lanes to get people quickly from one area to the next bypassing traffic. 

-Citywalk V2. A new shopping/restaurant district connected to the new park. Also connected to the parking garages for people driving in. Disney has things like Circ de Soule and NBA experience so look for a couple of big venues to go up.

UniversalOrlando,"Hey guys, so i was thinking about what some cool attractions we might find at Super Mario World. I know that it is more or less confirmed we will be getting all the attractions that were slated for SMW when it was supposed to be built in the Kids Zone at the Universal Studios park, but since it's going to be part of the new park with more land to expand, I'd like to think they have developed, or will develop, some attractions that haven't even been rumored yet. So I've come up with a few ideas myself &amp; I'd like to know what you all think.

* Luigi's Mansion AR - this will be a dark ride in which guests move through the mansion in omni-rover ride vehicles, each vehicle holding a single pair, with ""Vacuum Cannons"" attached, used to catch ghosts. The ride design is similar to Buzz Light-Year at the Magic Kingdom, except will utilize the same technology found in Mario Kart AR. The vehicles will move through live sets, but the ghosts will appear using AR goggles that are synced up with the cannons. 
* Mario Party Madness! - this ride will seat 4 guests per car, with the vehicle having limited mo-sim capabilities. The ride vehicles will move along a track that will include various paths &amp; be themed around the games, which will allow for a number of very different experiences. There will be 5-6 sections in which the ride car will enter a single theater room which will allow riders to play a classic Mario Party mini-game using buttons that are fitted to each seat. The buttons are also used to vote on which path to take when forks are encountered. 
* Star Fox: Galactic Voyager - this ride will be similar in design to the Smuggler's Run ride at Disneyland; six or so guests will sit in an individual ride vehicle that is synced up with its own screen. Two riders will serve as pilots, while the other riders will control turrets that shoot down enemies on the screen. I know it sounds like it'd just be a rip off but I think its a really neat ride idea that meshes well with the interactivity the park seems to be aiming for. 

I could also see them adding Expansion to Super Mario World based around the Pok√©mon &amp; Legend of Zelda properties; I've got a couple ideas for those as well:

* Pok√©mon Snap Tour - guests will ride on a slow moving boat through various landscapes featuring a wide array of animatronic Pok√©mon. Each guest will be given a special camera that will be used to take photos of the Pok√©mon, but will also be able to rate the quality of each photo &amp; log photos / scores. Guests will be able to compare scores at the end and have the photos printed at the picture booth. 
* The Legend of Zelda: The Lost Dungeon - guests will move on foot in a party of 8 through various rooms. Each guest will be given a *crossbow* that will be used to shoot virtual enemies that will appear on screen on one of or multiple walls in certain rooms. Killing an enemy will award the party gold. Certain rooms will feature chests that can either be unlocked by solving a short puzzle or via purchase using gold that has been collected. Key items will drastically change the narrative of the attraction as the party progresses through each room.

UniversalOrlando,"Hey guys, been lurking around this sub for a while now!  


I'm taking my family (parents and brother) on a trip to Universal Studios in Florida in two weeks. This will be my brother's and my first time there, and even though my parents have visited, they said that so many things have changed since they last went. Unfortunately, we'll only be at Universal Studios for about a day, so I'm looking for some advice for getting the most out of it in such a (short :( ) period of time.   


I'm looking for tips that especially help with planning our itinerary in the park: What would be the most efficient way to get through everything in the park, is the Fast Pass worth it, and would extending our stay at Universal for an extra day be worth it (financially and experience-wise)?  


Thank you so much!",One Day At Universal Studios (First Timer Needing Advice)
UniversalOrlando,"I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get destroyed for this but hear me out, People love the MCU movies, even I do to an extent, but to be honest, they are somewhat overrated, I‚Äôd say 70% are the same plot, basically the same movie every time, it‚Äôs almost like the movies are becoming too predictable, and for me they lack the soul that movies like The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2, X2, and Logan had. But one thing I noticed is this trend didn‚Äôt start UNTIL Disney bought out Marvel, Iron Man was made in 08, before the buyout, and I felt like that was actually a good movie, and not just a good ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù movie. Now these MCU movies are good ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù movies, but they aren‚Äôt good movies in general if you ask me, they are bland at times, too comedic when it‚Äôs not the right time to laugh, and like I said earlier, too generic and too predictable, I‚Äôve started becoming bored even. 

The reason I say Comcast should‚Äôve bought them out, is because Comcast owns Universal, Universal for the most part makes great movies (Jaws, Jurassic Park, Classic monsters, etc..) so I think if Universal helped make those movies the same way Warner Bros. Always has with DC, the end result could be more than just good ‚Äúsuperhero‚Äù movies. Plus Universal has a much better working relationship with 20th Century Fox (before Disney bought them out), Sony, And WB, it would‚Äôve been easier to work around the whole ‚ÄúX-men are 20thCF, Spidey is Sony, etc..) and we could‚Äôve gotten these characters a lot quicker than we did, PLUS we would‚Äôve seen more Hulk movies since Universal still owns rights to the Hulk. 

The other reason, Disney is PROBABLY NOT going to allow Marvel to make another R rated movie, that means NO authentic Deadpool, NO authentic Blade, NO authentic Punisher, and we can forget about seeing another Unhinged version of Wolverine ever again, which is a shame, Comcast would‚Äôve let them run loose to do whatever they wanted to do, in fact I think a lot of these movies would have been so much deeper than the generic light hearted films were used to seeing, they keep saying the new Dr. Strange will be scary, somehow I doubt it. 

Another thing for theme park goers is Marvel is being so difficult with Universal saying they can‚Äôt update any of their Marvel rides at Universal studios Orlando, that part of the park while still brilliant is stuck in the 90s and anyone born after 2000 isn‚Äôt going to understand (I do as a 90s kid), Universal will never get rid of that part of the park to disney as it‚Äôs part of the parks identity now. 

And for the gamers out there, anyone that enjoys Marvel vs Capcom probably noticed the lacking quality of the most recent title, and I‚Äôll tell you straight up that had ALOT more to do with Disney than it did capcom, yes I know capcom used to make Disney games, but Disney is a lot different than they were in the early 90s, Universal has a good working relationship with capcom, they allow Resident Evil to have their own attraction at Universal Studios Japan, both companies work a lot with Sony too, so imo MvC would still be a top tier fighting game had it not been for Disney. 

I know a lot of people LOVE Disney and I like Disney don‚Äôt get me wrong, but I just don‚Äôt think of Marvel as a Disney property, especially not in the way DC is with WB (Time Warner). In fact since 1999 I‚Äôve said Marvel and Universal (Comcast) are perfect for each other.

I‚Äôm sure many will disagree, but this is why I posted this on r/unpopularopinion

UniversalOrlando,"So my question is with Disney owning Marvel and all and literally neighboring US I‚Äôm surprised that Disney still lets US use the marvel properties, now I do know a deal was made so that basically only that Park (IoA) or anywhere on the east coast US can use certain marvel characters but idk, makes me wonder if Disney plans to buy them out. 

Which would be a shame, the Incredible Hulk Coaster is one of my favorite roller coasters around, and the Spider-Man 3D ride is BY FAR my favorite indoor ride let alone 3D. And one thing I love about that part of the park is it has that 90s Marvel vibe to it, and isn‚Äôt basically copy and paste of everything from the MCU (not necessarily a bad thing) and growing up in the 90s that era of marvel is still arguably my favorite since I was still a kid back then.

My question is does anyone know if Disney plans to take back marvel characters from Unviersal? Or my details on why they won‚Äôt? Thanks for the input.",What is the future of Marvel superhero land in IoA?

UniversalOrlando,"So with The Dark Crystal: Age of Resistance dropping on Netflix August 30th, it has potential to become a very popular franchise.  Netflix is a great platform since SO MANY people subscribe to it &amp; I'd really like to see the franchise take off from there. And if it does, I think it'd be perfect to replace the remaining Lost Continent section of IOA. 

The Dark Crystal takes place in the fantasy world of Thra, &amp; unlike Harry Potter, it is a very alien world in which the creatures, inhabitants &amp; environments bare little to no resemblance to the real world. It's about as high fantasy as you can get &amp; its also ripe for theming. Stuck between the cartoonish Suess Landing &amp; the more grounded, yet fantastical, Wizarding World area, The Dark Crystal would fit perfectly. 

A single large scale attraction could be built to take over the area that currently houses Sinbad &amp; Poseidon's Furry. I'm talking a 7+ minute traditional dark ride that utilizes mostly animatronics and practical effects, as opposed to the more screen based attractions Universal has been creating lately (I know Hagrid's ride is entirely themed with live sets and animatronics but its only a couple short sections in a ride that is mostly a roller coaster through the forrest). 

Or, if they find a way to work it in with the room they have, they can build the dark ride but also keep the show building for Sinbad but instead of a stunt show, make it a short show brought to life through special effects &amp; puppeteering. 

Universal also own the distribution right to the OG film, Netflix seems to have a working relationship with Universal Creative since Stranger Things is the highlight of HHN now, &amp; the Jim Henson Co. seems like they would be totally on board with bringing The Dark Crystal to a theme park. 

I know Legend of Zelda has been rumored for the area but I think a land for that would fair better being paired with Super Mario World in the new park. Plus, &amp; this is just a small gripe that might not bother other people, but I feel like the medieval-esque architecture of the Zelda franchise, with castles &amp; the like, might be a bit too similar to HP. But, as I said, it would be a small gripe should they chose to go this route. 

Anyways, what do you all think? Do you think The Dark Crystal would make for a good re-theming of the Lost Continent or do you think the franchise is just too obscure, even with the new series coming out, to work?",Idea: Dark Crystal replace The Lost Continent - Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Like the post says, going in November for a week for honeymoon. Looking forward most to Harry Potter World, which I visited for a day over a year ago - had tons of fun, but seeing as we have all three parks and five whole days (coming into Orlando on Sunday, staying on site Mon-Fri, leaving Saturday) I was wondering what your top tips are, your favorite ""must ride"" coasters, foods to try when we get there... anything really!  


And curious, for weekdays in November, how bad will the wait times be? I've had season passes to other theme parks and found weekdays during the school year always had less wait times, is that true for Universal as well?

UniversalOrlando,"I just got back from Universal yesterday. I had an incredible time and the main highlight was getting on Hagrid‚Äôs motorbike. The Ride is truly incredible and in my opinion greatly lives up to the hype. Here‚Äôs some tips to get on: 

- Hagrid‚Äôs Motorbike is on the Island of Adventure side. This park opens at 9:00 am. If you are staying at a Universal resort and think you will be gaining an advantage being that the park opens an hour early for you, you‚Äôll be in line with everyone else. Diagon Alley and the universal side is the only park that opens at 8:00 am for those staying on the resort. 

- Be prepared to run. Realistically, the only way to get on this ride with a reasonable wait is to get to the gate by no later than 8:00 am. I arrived at 8:00 am and there were already hundreds in line. Around 8:30 they open the gates and everyone started running. As soon as you hit the Dr. Seuss area there is a chain that blocks it off where everyone is held until 9:00. Once 9:00 hits mayhem breaks loose. It is survival of the fittest lol the faster you can run the less your wait will be. The fastest way is to go to the right of the carrousel because everyone goes left. If you are quick enough you‚Äôll meet paths with the massve mob of people but cut them off and beat out a ton of people. Being first in line to the hogwarts express will not work because it is way too slow and you will not reach hogsmeade in time. 

- Give your belongings to someone you are with. Like all other rollercoaster rides, there is a locker area for any loose belongings. I must have heard 10 people yelling how upset they were because they brought bags that didn‚Äôt fit in a locker and couldn‚Äôt ride. I went with just my universal park ticket and gave everything else to my brother who didn‚Äôt want to ride. BTW, There is no need for an express pass being that there is no express line. 

- The wait is always 3 hours or more after 9:30 am. The ride is so new that they shut it down at 6:00 pm to do maintenance checks so the morning is really your only option. If you want to wait 3 hours go for it, but the ride shuts down more maintence consistently that it is very risky and not guaranteed you‚Äôll be getting on. 

Overall, I rode and was out by 9:20. I waited in Hagrid‚Äôs line for 15 minutes and outside the gate for an hour so 1:15 all in. Universal definitely will have to figure something out. If you have small children by the time you reach the line it‚Äôs too long. If you have any questions let me know I‚Äôd be happy to help. I‚Äôd hate for you to miss out on such a great ride!",TIps For Getting In Line For Hagrid‚Äôs Motorbike

My family is coming to visit me in Orlando in October, and we are looking at going to IOA for a Saturday during HHN. My understanding is USF closes around 5pm during that season, but IOA is still open.
